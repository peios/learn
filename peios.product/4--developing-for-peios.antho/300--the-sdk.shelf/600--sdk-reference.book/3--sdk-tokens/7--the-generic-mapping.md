description: The canonical generic-to-specific rights mapping for the token object class, exported for you to pass to an access check.

```c
extern const struct kacs_generic_mapping peios_token_generic_mapping;
```

The canonical generic→specific rights mapping for the **token** object class. Pass it to [`peios_access_map_generic`](~peios/sdk-security/security-h-security-descriptors#access-masks) or as the `mapping` in a [`peios_access_request`](~peios/sdk-access/access-h-access-checks#the-request) when the object under check is a token.
