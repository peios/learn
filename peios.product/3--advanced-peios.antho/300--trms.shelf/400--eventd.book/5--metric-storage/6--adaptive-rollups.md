title: Adaptive Rollups
description: How repeated wide metric-window queries seed a bounded, self-validating cache without adding work to ingestion.
---

Raw rows in `samples` are always authoritative.
[*rollup.raw-samples-are-always-authoritative]
The `rollups` table is a
disposable query cache: deleting every rollup can make a query slower, but
cannot change its answer.
[*rollup.deleting-every-rollup-never-changes-a-query-answer]
A miss or a stale row is computed directly from raw
samples and returned immediately; query execution never waits for the cache to
be repaired.
[*rollup.a-miss-or-stale-row-is-answered-from-raw-samples-without-waiting-for-repair]

The design protects eventd's primary job. Metric ingestion does not inspect,
update or coordinate with rollups.
[*rollup.metric-ingestion-never-touches-rollups]
A query computes a candidate while doing
work it already needed for its own answer, and submits that candidate through a
bounded non-blocking channel.
[*rollup.queries-submit-candidates-through-a-bounded-non-blocking-channel]
The sole metric writer considers at most one such
command only after the receive queue is idle and the current sample batch is
committed.
[*rollup.the-writer-takes-at-most-one-rollup-command-and-only-when-idle-and-committed]
A full command channel, writer pressure or any ordinary cache-write
failure drops the candidate rather than delaying ingestion.
[*rollup.a-full-channel-writer-pressure-or-write-failure-drops-the-candidate]

## Eligible queries

A query can read or seed rollups only when all of these are true:

- it has `SINCE` and an explicit `AVG_OVER`, `MIN_OVER`, `MAX_OVER` or
  `SUM_OVER` function;
  [*rollup.eligibility-requires-since-and-an-explicit-window-function]
- the selected output is per series — the selector is bracketed, or it resolves
  to exactly one series;
  [*rollup.eligibility-requires-per-series-output]
- it has no `WHERE` predicate or cross-type filter; and
  [*rollup.eligibility-excludes-where-predicates-and-cross-type-filters]
- `AdaptiveRollupMaxRows` is non-zero.
  [*rollup.eligibility-requires-a-non-zero-adaptiverollupmaxrows]

The label selector has already selected concrete series and is therefore safe.
An unbracketed multi-series query is not eligible because its window result
combines series; reusing independently cached averages or extrema would not in
general reproduce that result. Predicate and cross-filter shapes remain on the
raw path because their result depends on more than the cached series window.

Only complete windows aligned to Unix-epoch multiples of the requested width
are cached. [*rollup.only-complete-epoch-aligned-windows-are-cached]
Any partial window at either end of the requested range is always
read from raw samples.
[*rollup.partial-edge-windows-are-always-read-from-raw-samples]
A query uses the cache only when every complete interior
window for the series has a valid row, including explicit empty-window rows;
otherwise it evaluates that series from raw samples.
[*rollup.a-series-uses-the-cache-only-when-every-interior-window-has-a-valid-row]
This all-or-raw rule keeps
the fallback simple and prevents a cache miss from changing transform pairing.

Streaming continuations do not use or seed rollups.
[*rollup.streaming-continuations-neither-use-nor-seed-rollups]
They preserve their normal
incremental raw-query semantics.

## Schema and identity [*rollup.schema-version-2-defines-the-rollups-table]

Metric schema version 2 adds:

```sql
CREATE TABLE rollups (
    series_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES series(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    window_start INTEGER NOT NULL,
    window_width INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (window_width > 0),
    transform INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (transform IN (0, 1, 2, 50, 95, 99)),
    function INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (function BETWEEN 0 AND 3),
    value REAL,
    overflow INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (overflow IN (0, 1)),
    source_max_sample_id INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (source_max_sample_id >= 0),
    source_baseline_sample_id INTEGER CHECK (source_baseline_sample_id > 0),
    CHECK (overflow = 0 OR value IS NULL),
    PRIMARY KEY
        (series_id, window_start, window_width, transform, function)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

`transform` distinguishes no transform, `RATE`, `DELTA`, `P50`, `P95` and
`P99`. [*rollup.transform-distinguishes-none-rate-delta-p50-p95-and-p99]
`function` distinguishes `AVG_OVER`, `MIN_OVER`, `MAX_OVER` and
`SUM_OVER`. [*rollup.function-distinguishes-the-four-window-functions]
`value` is null only for an empty window or a percentile overflow;
`overflow` distinguishes those cases.
[*rollup.value-is-null-only-for-an-empty-window-or-a-percentile-overflow]
Empty rows are necessary to prove that a
complete cached range really has no missing window.

Opening a version-1 metric store creates the table and its pruning index in one
immediate transaction, then records version 2, and continues to version 3
(§5.4).
[*rollup.a-version-1-store-gains-the-table-and-pruning-index-in-one-immediate-transaction]
Unknown versions still fail
startup (§5.4, §B).

## Validity proof

Each row records the greatest raw sample `id` observed inside its window as
`source_max_sample_id`.
[*rollup.a-row-records-the-greatest-sample-id-in-its-window]
Before serving it, the query engine proves that the same
series and window has no sample with a greater `id`.
[*rollup.a-row-is-served-only-if-its-window-has-no-greater-sample-id]
A later sample therefore
makes the row stale even when its timestamp was backfilled into an old window.
[*rollup.a-backfilled-sample-makes-its-windows-row-stale]
An empty window records zero, so its first raw sample also invalidates it.
[*rollup.an-empty-window-records-zero-and-its-first-sample-invalidates-it]

`RATE` and `DELTA` additionally depend on the sample immediately preceding the
window. Their rows record that sample's id in `source_baseline_sample_id`, with
null meaning no preceding sample existed.
[*rollup.rate-and-delta-rows-record-the-preceding-sample-id-as-their-baseline]
The query engine compares this with
the current immediately preceding sample. A new, changed or deleted baseline
makes the row stale.
[*rollup.a-new-changed-or-deleted-baseline-makes-a-rate-or-delta-row-stale]

Retention invalidates all rollups for every series from which it deletes a raw
sample before it deletes the sample (§5.5). This is deliberately conservative.
The query-time proof remains mandatory: maintenance ordering alone is not a
freshness guarantee.
[*rollup.the-query-time-validity-proof-is-always-performed]

Non-finite cached values are rejected.
[*rollup.non-finite-cached-values-are-rejected] As everywhere in metric evaluation, a
numeric result must be finite; percentile overflow is represented by the
explicit null-and-overflow state instead (§6, PSPU §3.25).

## Seeding and bounds

An eligible raw evaluation may enqueue candidates only after it has scanned at
least `AdaptiveRollupMinSamples` raw inputs.
[*rollup.seeding-requires-at-least-adaptiverollupminsamples-raw-inputs]
It enqueues no more than
`AdaptiveRollupBatchRows` missing windows, and submission uses `try_send` on a
fixed-capacity channel.
[*rollup.one-submission-carries-at-most-adaptiverollupbatchrows-windows-via-try-send]
Repeating a wide query gradually fills its cache in
bounded pieces without starting a background scanner.
[*rollup.there-is-no-background-rollup-scanner]

The writer upserts a candidate under the complete cache identity and prunes the
oldest window starts until no more than `AdaptiveRollupMaxRows` remain.
[*rollup.the-writer-upserts-then-prunes-oldest-windows-down-to-adaptiverollupmaxrows]
The cap
is global to the metric store.
[*rollup.the-row-cap-is-global-to-the-metric-store]
It limits this optional acceleration state; it
does not delete series or raw samples.
[*rollup.pruning-never-deletes-series-or-raw-samples]

All three controls are live (§A).
[*rollup.the-three-rollup-controls-take-effect-live]
Setting `AdaptiveRollupMaxRows` to zero
immediately disables cache reads and writes without changing query results.
[*rollup.a-zero-row-cap-disables-rollups-immediately-without-changing-results]

Adaptive rollups are not downsampling. Raw samples retain their ordinary age
and size policy, and every supported query remains answerable from them (§5.5).
[*rollup.rollups-leave-raw-sample-retention-unchanged]
