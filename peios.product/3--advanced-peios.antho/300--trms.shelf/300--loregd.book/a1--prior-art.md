description: loregd is specified against SQLite rather than an abstract store — how it relates to SQLite, the Windows hive format, and RSI.

## SQLite

loregd's storage engine is SQLite, and it is specified against SQLite
rather than against an abstract store. The schema, the concurrency model,
and the operational behaviour all name SQLite features directly: WAL mode
for concurrent readers alongside a serialised writer, savepoints and
transactions for atomicity, `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint` for durability on
demand, and its crash recovery for restart after an unclean shutdown.

Both halves of a hive are SQLite. Persistent data lives in the database
file named on the command line; volatile data lives in a second,
in-memory database attached to the same connections (§3.3). Using one
engine for both is what makes a transaction spanning persistent and
volatile data atomic without any additional machinery.

A different storage engine would have to supply equivalent transactional
and concurrency semantics. Nothing in the design forbids that, but
nothing accommodates it either.

## The Windows registry hive format

The Windows registry stores hives as binary REGF files managed directly
by the kernel's Configuration Manager. loregd departs from that model
completely: storage is a SQLite database managed by an unprivileged
userspace daemon, not a kernel-managed binary file, and the kernel holds
no storage of its own at all.

What the two share is the data model — keys, values, security descriptors
— which Peios inherits through the registry's kernel-side specification
rather than from the file format. The on-disk format has no relationship
to REGF whatsoever, and no REGF file can be read by loregd or written by
it.

## The Registry Source Interface

loregd implements the RSI, which is
[specified in PSPK](~peios/registry-source-interface/scope) rather than
here. That specification defines the operations, the message format, the
error model, and the obligations binding on any source; loregd's request
handling (chapter 5) is a mapping of those operations onto SQL against
the two stores.

Where this manual and the RSI specification disagree about wire
behaviour, the specification is correct and this manual has a bug — the
RSI is a contract with the kernel, and loregd is one implementation of
one side of it.
