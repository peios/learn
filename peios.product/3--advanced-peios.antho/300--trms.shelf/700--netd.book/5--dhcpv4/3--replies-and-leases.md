title: Replies and leases
description: Which DHCPv4 replies the client accepts, the server-identity lock, what makes an OFFER or an ACK acceptable, and how an ACK is read into a lease — prefix, routes, T1 and T2, and the options kept.
---

## Which replies are looked at [*dhcp4-lease.reply-filter]

A received message is ignored unless all of these hold:

- it is a BOOTREPLY;
- its transaction id is the client's current one;
- its `chaddr` is the interface's MAC;
- it carries a message type (option 53) the client knows.

## The server lock [*dhcp4-lease.server-lock]

Once a server has been chosen — the server of the lease held, or else the
server identifier of the offer being requested — an ACK or NAK is
accepted only if its option 54 names that server. A stranger who guesses
the transaction id cannot take a lease away or substitute one.

In Rebooting, with no lease and no offer, no server has been chosen, so
an ACK or NAK from any server is accepted.

## What each state accepts [*dhcp4-lease.state-table]

| State | Message | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Selecting | OFFER with a non-zero `yiaddr` and a server identifier | taken: Requesting. The first acceptable OFFER wins; there is no comparison between offers. |
| Selecting | OFFER without either | ignored |
| Requesting, Rebooting, Renewing, Rebinding | ACK that reads as a lease (below) | Bound, with the lease |
| Requesting, Rebooting, Renewing, Rebinding | ACK that does not read as a lease | ignored; retransmission continues |
| Requesting, Rebooting | NAK | Selecting; the previous address and the offer are forgotten |
| Renewing, Rebinding | NAK | the lease is lost (§5.4); Selecting |
| any other combination | | ignored |

An ACK in Renewing or Rebinding that grants a different address replaces
the lease. The next reconcile removes the old address and adds the new.

## Reading an ACK [*dhcp4-lease.ack-requirements]

An ACK is a lease only when it has:

- a non-zero `yiaddr`;
- a server identifier (option 54);
- a lease time (option 51) of exactly 4 bytes, and at least 4 seconds.

A lease time under 4 s is refused: it cannot hold T1 < T2 < lease, and a
server asking for it wants the client to spin.

### The prefix [*dhcp4-lease.prefix]

From the subnet mask (option 1) when it is a non-zero run of contiguous
ones. Otherwise, absent or malformed, from the address's class: /8 for
a first octet up to 127, /16 up to 191, /24 above.

### Routes [*dhcp4-lease.routes]

Classless static routes (option 121, RFC 3442) are read as a sequence of
prefix length, the significant destination octets, and a 4-byte gateway.
**A prefix length above 32, or an entry running past the end of the
option, makes the whole ACK fail to read as a lease**: it is ignored like
any other unusable ACK.

When classless routes are present, the router option (3) is ignored. The
lease's gateway is the first router of option 3, or, when classless
routes are present, the gateway of the classless route with prefix 0.

### T1 and T2 [*dhcp4-lease.t1-t2]

- **T1** is option 58 when it is above 0 and below the lease time minus
  2. Otherwise it is half the lease time.
- **T2** is option 59 when it is above T1 and below the lease time.
  Otherwise it is seven-eighths of the lease time, rounded down, raised to
  at least T1 + 1 and capped at the lease time minus 1.

So T1 < T2 < the lease time always holds, whatever the server sent.

### Other options kept [*dhcp4-lease.options-kept]

| Option | Kept as |
|---|---|
| 6 | DNS servers, every 4-byte entry |
| 15 | the domain name: the bytes up to the first NUL; dropped if not UTF-8 |
| 119 | the domain search list, RFC 1035 names with compression pointers followed, at most 16 jumps per name |
| 12 | the hostname offered: the bytes up to the first NUL; dropped if not UTF-8 |
| 26 | the MTU, when it is at least 68 |
| 28 | the broadcast address |
| 42 | NTP servers, every 4-byte entry |

Where an option appears twice, its first occurrence is used.
Nothing else in the ACK is kept.

How each of these is used — and whether, by the profile — is in §4.2
(addresses, routes, MTU), §8.3 (DNS and NTP) and §8.4 (the hostname).

## The record of a lease

A lease is logged as `interface <name>: lease <address>/<prefix> from
<server> for <seconds>s`. Binding clears the interface's link-local
address and its warning, and marks the interface for re-judgement,
because the network may now be identifiable (§7.1).
