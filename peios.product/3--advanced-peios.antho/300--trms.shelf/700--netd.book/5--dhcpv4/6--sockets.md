title: Sockets
description: The sockets behind netd's DHCPv4 client — the per-interface packet socket and its filter, the broadcast path from 0.0.0.0, the unicast path from the lease address, and the udp/68 absorber.
---

Before an interface has an address, nothing but a packet socket can send
from `0.0.0.0`. So every DHCPv4 broadcast leaves through `AF_PACKET`, with
an IPv4 and UDP header netd builds itself, and every reply is read from
the same socket.

## The packet socket [*dhcp4-sockets.packet-socket]

One per running client: `AF_PACKET`, `SOCK_DGRAM`, protocol `ETH_P_IP`,
bound to the interface. A classic BPF filter passes only an IPv4 UDP
datagram whose fragment offset is zero and that is addressed to port 68.
It tests the offset alone, not the more-fragments flag, so a later
fragment is refused but a first fragment passes. Everything read is
checked again for an IPv4 header and UDP port 68, but not for
fragmentation, then decoded as a DHCP message: a first fragment is
decoded as if it were the whole datagram.

The socket sees every frame on the interface that passes the filter, so
it receives both broadcast replies and replies unicast to the lease
address.

## The broadcast path [*dhcp4-sockets.broadcast-frame]

DISCOVER, REQUEST in Requesting and Rebooting, and REQUEST in Rebinding go
out on the packet socket to Ethernet `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`, as one IPv4
datagram:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| source | `0.0.0.0` |
| destination | `255.255.255.255` |
| TOS | `0x10` |
| identification | 0 |
| flags | don't-fragment |
| TTL | 64 |
| UDP ports | 68 → 67 |
| UDP checksum | 0 (none, which IPv4 permits) |

## The unicast path [*dhcp4-sockets.unicast-renewal]

REQUEST in Renewing, and RELEASE, go out on a transient `AF_INET` UDP
socket with `SO_REUSEADDR` and `SO_BINDTODEVICE` set to the interface,
bound to the lease address on port 68, sent to the server on port 67, and
closed. The kernel resolves the server's link-layer address. The reply
is read from the packet socket.

Binding port 68 meets the kernel's port reservation for ports 1 to 1023,
which the shipped seed grants to SYSTEM, netd's identity.

## The absorber [*dhcp4-sockets.absorber]

At startup netd binds one more UDP socket, to `0.0.0.0:68` with
`SO_REUSEADDR`, and discards whatever arrives on it. Its only purpose is
that a server's unicast reply finds a bound port, so the kernel does not
answer it with ICMP port-unreachable. The packet sockets see the same
datagrams. If it cannot be bound, netd runs without it (§2.1).
