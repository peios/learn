title: Overview
description: netd is the Peios network manager — a single-threaded reconciler that executes PNP's interface layer, runs its own DHCPv4, router-discovery and DHCPv6 clients, and publishes readiness and DNS facts. What is unusual about it.
---

**netd** is the Peios network manager. It is the executor of the
interface layer of PNP, the Peios Network Policy: it reads which
interfaces join which networks, and how they stand there, from
`Machine\System\Network`, and makes the kernel match. It runs as a
SYSTEM service started at boot, and it is the only program on a Peios
machine that configures links, addresses and routes.

Three decisions shape everything else in this manual.

**It is a reconciler, not a command interpreter.** netd keeps no list of
things it has done. On every input — a kernel link or address event, a
registry change, a DHCP or router-discovery packet, a timer, a control
request — it re-derives what each interface should look like and applies
the difference from what the kernel reports. Nothing happens imperatively
in a handler. Two consequences follow directly: a manual change to an
interface netd manages lasts until the next pass, and a restarted netd
derives its desired state afresh. That costs a leased interface its
address and default route until the server answers the new process's
first request (§2.1); static configuration is desired from the first
pass and stays.

**It owns addresses wholly and routes only by mark.** On an interface
netd has joined, every IPv4 address and every non-link-local IPv6 address
is netd's: anything else is removed. Routes are netd's only when they
carry routing protocol 200, the number netd stamps on every route it
adds, so a route another program adds for itself survives. The kernel's
own IPv6 link-local address is never touched.

**It is the only router-advertisement listener.** netd switches the
kernel's own RA processing off on every interface before it does
anything else, and acts on advertisements itself, so exactly one place
decides what an advertisement means. The kernel still makes link-local
addresses and answers neighbour solicitations; everything an
advertisement could configure — addresses, the default route, DNS, the
MTU — is netd's decision, filtered through the interface's profile.

netd builds and judges the interface layer with `pnp-core`, the same
engine the kernel's NTFE uses for the packet layers, so a rule means the
same thing in every layer. The kernel never reads `Rules\Interface`;
netd never reads the packet layers. Each executor validates and refuses
its own layers on its own.

## Where netd sits

   registry (Machine\System\Network)          peinit

   registry (written back)
```

What netd writes back to the registry is read by others: the kernel
reads each interface's `Status Network` to give the packet layers their
`Network.*` facts (PKM §6.5), services and scripts watch `Readiness`,
and resolvd subscribes to netd's DNS snapshots over the control socket
(PSPU §6.9).

## What netd does not do

- **Answer names.** netd reports what each interface contributes to name
  resolution; resolvd routes and answers queries.
- **Filter packets.** The packet layers are NTFE's. netd's own DHCP and
  router-discovery traffic passes them only because the shipped baseline
  policy permits it.
- **Decide who can bind a port.** That is the kernel's port reservation
  table.
- **Associate with wireless networks.** A supplicant brings a wireless
  link up; netd then treats it as any other interface.
- **Hold leases across a reboot.** Nothing about a lease is persisted; a
  rebooted machine asks for the address its network last gave it (§5.7).
