title: The loop
description: netd's single thread and single poll — its inputs, how each one leads to a full pass or a reconcile, and the converge sequence that repeats until the kernel stops changing.
---

netd is one thread around one `poll(2)`. [*loop.one-thread-one-poll]
Every input is a descriptor in the poll set or a timer deadline, and every
handler records what it learnt and lets the end of the iteration act on
it. Because there is one thread, a handler that blocks holds everything
up: no DHCP timer fires and no kernel event is read until it returns.

## Inputs

| Input | Descriptor | What it leads to |
|---|---|---|
| Kernel events | the rtnetlink multicast socket | a fresh dump, then a full pass |
| Registry changes | the watch on `Machine\System\Network` | a reload (§2.3), then a full pass |
| udp/68 absorber | the absorber socket | drained and discarded |
| DHCPv4 replies | one packet socket per running client | the client's actions; a reconcile if the network changed |
| Router advertisements | one ICMPv6 socket per interface doing router discovery | the engine's actions; a full pass if anything changed |
| DHCPv6 replies | one UDP socket per running DHCPv6 client | the client's actions; a reconcile if the DNS facts changed |
| Control requests | the control socket listener | the request (§9.2); `reconcile` runs a full pass |
| Time | the earliest deadline of any client | every client's timers, each acted on as above |

The poll timeout is the earliest deadline any DHCPv4, router-discovery
or DHCPv6 client holds; with none, netd waits indefinitely.

After a kernel event netd does not fold the event into its model. It
dumps the whole state again and always runs a full pass, because a dump
taken after an apply can already show a state whose consequences have not
been decided yet. [*loop.kernel-event-redumps-and-converges]

## A full pass [*loop.full-pass-sequence]

A full pass runs these steps, in this order:

1. identify networks on joined interfaces with carrier (§7.1);
2. bring the interface table in line with the kernel's links and judge
   every non-loopback interface (§3.3), stopping the clients of an
   interface that lost carrier or whose outcome changed;
3. start DHCPv4 clients where due (§5.1);
4. start or stop router discovery and DHCPv6 (§6.1, §6.3);
5. reconcile every interface (§4.3) and dump the kernel's state again.

It then repeats steps 1 to 5 while the dump differs from the one before
the reconcile. [*loop.converge-repeats-until-stable]
The steps run at most four times in one pass, the first run included,
even if the dump is still changing after the fourth.

Applying changes alters what the next decisions see: bringing a link up
gives it carrier, carrier starts a DHCP client, and a lease adds an
address. One pass would leave that chain waiting for a later event that,
on a virtual NIC, has already arrived.

After the repeats, the pass applies the hostname (§8.4) and publishes:
the machine level to peinit and the registry, every joined interface's
`Status`, and a DNS snapshot to subscribers if it changed (§8.2, §8.3).

## Reconcile without a full pass

A DHCPv4 lease arriving, a lease being lost, link-local fallback, and a
DHCPv6 answer each change only what an interface should carry, so they
lead to a reconcile of every interface, the hostname, and a publish,
without re-judging anything. If the same iteration also needs a full
pass, only the full pass runs.

A DHCPv4 lease also marks its interface for re-judgement, because the
network on the other side might now be identifiable (§7.1). Any interface
so marked makes the iteration run a full pass.
