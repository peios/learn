description: The net command as built — each subcommand, what it reads, how net wait and net policy wait decide, and its exit statuses.
---

`net` is netd's operator command. It talks to netd over the control
socket, and reads the registry directly for `rules` and `profiles`,
because those are configuration that netd merely executes. Changing the
network is a registry write; `net` shows state and pokes the daemon. The
task-oriented guide is `~peios/networking/the-net-command`.

## Subcommands [*net.subcommands]

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `net status` | prints the status reply (§9.2) |
| `net renew <interface>` | sends `renew` |
| `net reconcile` | sends `reconcile` |
| `net rules` | prints `Rules\Interface` from the registry: one line per rule, indented by depth, with its priority, `(disabled)` for `Enabled = 0`, its conditions, and its actions (`NULL` when it has none) |
| `net profiles`, `net profile list` | prints `Profiles\` from the registry: one line per profile, indented by depth, with the values it sets itself (`(inherits only)` when none) and `(disabled)` |
| `net wait <link\|addressed\|routed> [seconds]` | waits for the machine level |
| `net policy` | prints the kernel engine's status: enforcing or not, the generation, unwalked changes, a refused last walk, the context count |
| `net policy wait [seconds]` | waits for the packet policy to be in force |
| `net version`, `net --version` | prints `net <version>` |

`rules` and `profiles` fail when their key does not exist. Neither
needs netd running.

## `net status` output [*net.status-output]

A `hostname` line (`(unset)` when empty) and a `readiness` line, then
`policy     REFUSED: <why> (the last good generation stands)` when there
is a refusal. Then a block per interface: `<name>  [<id>]`, then `verdict`
(`<VERDICT>(<profile>) by <rule>`, or `(none) by <rule>`), `state`, and
`readiness` for a joined interface. Then, where present, `hardware`,
`network` (`<name> [<id>] trust <trust>`), each `address`, `gateway`,
`gateway6`, `dns`, `search`, `lease` (`<state> from <server>, <n>s
left`) and `warning`.

## `net wait` [*net.wait]

It asks for `status` every 500 ms and succeeds as soon as the machine
level is at least the one named. An error reaching netd is printed and
the wait goes on. The timeout is the second argument, or 60 s when absent
or not a number. When it lapses, `net` prints `net: timed out waiting for
<level>` and fails.

`absent` is accepted as a level, and is met at once.

## `net policy wait` [*net.policy-wait]

It reads `/dev/peios-ntfe`'s status (ABI 5) once and takes the number of
policy changes the engine has noted as its target. It then polls every
5 ms until the engine's count of changes walked reaches the target. If
the last walk was refused, it fails, naming the errno and the generation
that stands; otherwise it succeeds. The timeout is the argument, or 10 s.
The counters are the kernel's (PKM §6.5). A device that answers with
another ABI fails at once.

## Exit status [*net.exit-status]

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | success |
| 1 | netd unreachable, an error reply, a timeout, a refused policy, or a registry key that cannot be opened |
| 2 | usage: an unknown subcommand, a wrong argument count, an unknown level, or a non-numeric `policy wait` timeout |
