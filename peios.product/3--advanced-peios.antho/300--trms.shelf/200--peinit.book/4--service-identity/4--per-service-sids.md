title: Per-Service SIDs
description: The SID derived from a service's name and carried in its token's group list — why it exists, and the uppercasing rule.
---

Every service token carries a SID derived from the service's name, in
its group list, alongside whatever the principal's own identity brings.

The derivation is the one KACS defines (Peios Kernel TRM §3.2). The
authority is `S-1-5-80`. The service name is uppercased and encoded as
UTF-16LE, SHA-1 is taken over those bytes, and the 20-byte digest is
split into five little-endian 32-bit sub-authorities:

```
S-1-5-80-<sub1>-<sub2>-<sub3>-<sub4>-<sub5>
```

peinit computes this itself, from the name alone, with no involvement
from anything else. authd computes the same value independently when it
mints a token, and the two implementations are pinned against each other
by a shared test vector.

## Why they exist

Per-service SIDs are what make access control useful when services share
a principal. Every platform daemon runs as SYSTEM, and every service
with no `Identity` runs as `LocalService`; without something to tell
them apart, an ACL could grant a right to "LocalService" and thereby
grant it to a dozen unrelated services.

With a per-service SID, an ACE can name one specific service. It costs
nothing — no account, no registry entry, no allocation — because it is a
hash of a name that already has to be unique.

They are load-bearing in more than access checks. peinit uses the
service SID directly when it provisions a service's runtime directories,
stamping `/run/<name>` with a descriptor that grants full access to
SYSTEM, Administrators, and that service's SID and nothing else (§3.3).

## The uppercasing rule

The name is uppercased before encoding, using full Unicode case mapping
— the one that expands `ß` to `SS` and `ﬁ` to `FI` rather than mapping
each code unit in place. peinit uppercases in the code-point domain,
before the UTF-16 encoding, so any expansion happens first.

For an ASCII service name, which is every real service, the choice is
invisible. It becomes visible only for a name containing a character
whose uppercase form is longer than itself.
