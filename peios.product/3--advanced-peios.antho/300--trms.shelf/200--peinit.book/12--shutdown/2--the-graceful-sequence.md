title: The Graceful Sequence
description: The ordered steps of a graceful shutdown, from entering the shutdown state to the final power action.
---

## Step 1: Enter the shutdown state

peinit sets an internal flag. While it is set, no new service starts.
[*graceful.no-new-service-starts-once-the-flag-is-set] Control commands
other than `status`, `list`, `operation-status`, `job-status`,
`job-list` and `job-stop` are rejected as invalid for the current
state.

Every live submitted job (§8.5) is stopped at this point too: SIGTERM
to each — unless it has already sent `STOPPING=1` — with cause
`shutdown`, its own `stop_timeout` to the kill, and no ordering between
jobs or against the service waves, because a job has no dependencies
to order by. [*graceful.every-live-submitted-job-is-stopped-at-once]
A job still queued for launch is cancelled with the same
cause. [*graceful.a-queued-job-is-cancelled-with-the-same-cause]
`submit` is refused for the rest of the shutdown; `status`,
`wait`, `stop` and `signal` keep answering, as do the control socket's
`job-status`, `job-list` and `job-stop`.
[*graceful.submit-is-refused-while-the-other-job-commands-keep-answering]

Timer triggers are disarmed. The timerfds stay armed and keep firing —
peinit gates the handler rather than the fd, matching how every other
event source is handled — but a firing during the shutdown window is
classified as a no-op and nothing is started or queued.
[*graceful.a-timer-firing-during-shutdown-is-a-no-op]

The gate matters more than the rule reads. The states a timer firing
would start from are Inactive, Completed and Failed, precisely the
states step 3 classifies as not participating, so a firing would create
a service after the plan was fixed: in no wave, not waited for, and not
reached by the global-timeout sweep, still holding files open when
peinit reaches the unmount step.

## Step 2: Suspend Critical failure semantics

A Critical service failing during shutdown is recorded but does not
trigger a reboot. [*graceful.a-critical-failure-during-shutdown-does-not-reboot]
The system is already going down, and rebooting from
here would loop.

## Step 3: Classify

Completed services — Oneshots with `RemainAfterExit` — have no process
and are transitioned to Inactive, releasing the dependency
relationships they were holding so their dependents can be stopped
cleanly. [*graceful.completed-services-are-transitioned-to-inactive]

The rest are classified for stop eligibility:

- **Active and Reloading** are graceful-stop eligible and enter the
  waves. [*graceful.active-and-reloading-enter-the-waves]
- **Stopping** services are already on a stop path. They join the waves
  for ordering and timeout purposes, but do **not** receive another
  SIGTERM. [*graceful.a-stopping-service-joins-the-waves-without-another-sigterm]
- **Starting** services are not eligible. peinit cancels the startup,
  SIGKILLs the service cgroup if one exists, and transitions them to
  Failed with cause `ShutdownWave` while post-kill verification is
  pending. [*graceful.a-starting-service-is-killed-and-failed]
  A cgroup still populated after the post-kill timeout takes
  the service to Abandoned with cause `ProcessUnkillable` and the cgroup
  is leaked. [*graceful.a-cgroup-that-survives-the-post-kill-timeout-is-abandoned]
  A Starting service whose job never forked skips the check
  and goes straight to Failed.
  [*graceful.an-unforked-starting-job-goes-straight-to-failed]
- **Inactive, Failed, Skipped, Backoff and Abandoned** do not
  participate. [*graceful.five-states-do-not-participate]
  Abandoned cgroups stay leaked and shutdown continues.

## Step 4: Stop in reverse dependency order [*graceful.no-service-stops-until-its-dependents-have]

peinit builds the reverse dependency graph over hard dependencies and
stops in waves:
[*graceful.each-eligible-service-gets-sigterm-then-a-cgroup-sigkill-at-stoptimeout]

1. Each eligible service receives SIGTERM. Already-stopping ones do not.
2. Each has `StopTimeout` to exit.
3. On expiry, SIGKILL to the service's entire cgroup.
4. No service is stopped until everything depending on it has stopped.

A service that sent `STOPPING=1` does not receive a SIGTERM at all: it
has already said it is shutting down, and peinit goes straight to the
stop deadline. [*graceful.a-service-that-sent-stopping-gets-no-sigterm]
The notification is acknowledged as a `notify.stopping`
event (§10.5), which is what makes the suppressed SIGTERM legible
afterwards rather than looking like one peinit failed to send.

### Timing an already-stopping service

peinit does not reset an already-Stopping service's clock, either when
shutdown begins or when its wave becomes eligible.
[*graceful.an-already-stopping-services-clock-is-not-reset] It uses the
timing evidence retained from the stop path that put the service in
Stopping:

- If a Stop operation, or a Restart executing its stop leg, is in
  flight, that operation's retained timing governs.
- Otherwise peinit uses service-level evidence, which carries the cause
  that initiated the transition — `ExplicitStop`, `ShutdownWave`,
  `ConflictEviction` or `BindsToPropagation`.

peinit requires the evidence to be present, to belong to a service
actually in Stopping, to carry a cause matching the service's current
cause, to name one of those four causes, and not to describe a deadline
earlier than its own start.
[*graceful.the-retained-evidence-must-meet-five-conditions]

Evidence that is missing, stale or ambiguous **fails closed** rather
than being guessed at. [*graceful.unsubstantiable-evidence-fails-closed]
A stop that began before the shutdown has already
spent part of its own clock, and inventing a fresh budget here would
hand the service a second full `StopTimeout`.

Failing closed costs that one participant, not the shutdown.
[*graceful.failing-closed-costs-only-that-participant] A service
whose evidence cannot substantiate a deadline is given no graceful
period at all: its deadline is already due, so the timeout scan
escalates it to SIGKILL on its wave, and the console says which way the
evidence was unusable:
[*graceful.an-unsubstantiated-deadline-kills-without-a-graceful-period]

```
peinit: shutdown cannot substantiate a stop timeout for <service>
(<reason>); killing it without a graceful period
```

Every other participant keeps its full `StopTimeout`, and the shutdown
runs to completion.

An operation whose lifetime expires while it is still Pending — a
later-wave stop waiting for its dependencies — fails that operation and
its waiters. It does **not** authorise signalling the service before its
wave is eligible.
[*graceful.a-pending-operations-expiry-does-not-signal-the-service-early]
Shutdown owns the signalling; the operation object is
an observation of it.

## Step 5: Global timeout [*graceful.shutdowntimeout-and-postkilltimeout-bound-the-sequence]

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Machine\System\Boot\ShutdownTimeout` | 90 | Seconds for the whole sequence. |
| `Machine\System\Boot\PostKillTimeout` | 5 | Seconds for a cgroup to drain after SIGKILL. |

On expiry, every remaining participant's cgroup is killed, anything that
does not drain within the post-kill timeout is marked Abandoned with its
cgroup leaked, and shutdown continues regardless.
[*graceful.on-the-global-timeout-everything-remaining-is-killed]
Live submitted jobs
are killed in the same sweep, whatever phase their stop had reached,
and abandoned on the same terms.
[*graceful.the-global-timeout-sweep-kills-live-jobs-too]

The sequence does not move to step 6 while a submitted job is live.
[*graceful.step-6-waits-for-every-live-submitted-job] A
job's reap advances shutdown progress exactly as a service's does, so a
session that exits promptly on SIGTERM costs the shutdown nothing, and
one that does not costs it `stop_timeout` and the post-kill grace.

## Step 6: Save the random seed

After every service has stopped and before any unmount, peinit writes a
fresh seed to `/var/state/peinit/random-seed` for the next boot: 512
bytes from the kernel CSPRNG on this machine, never copied from an
image, protected so that only SYSTEM-equivalent authority can read or
replace it. [*graceful.a-512-byte-seed-is-written-before-any-unmount]

The write is crash-conscious: a temporary file on the same filesystem,
written, flushed, atomically renamed over the old seed, and the
containing directory flushed.
[*graceful.the-seed-write-is-a-flush-and-atomic-rename] A failure is
recorded and shutdown continues.

The forced and Critical-reboot paths skip it, along with the unmount
step, and go directly to sync and the final action.

## Step 7: Unmount [*graceful.every-non-root-mount-is-unmounted-deepest-first]

1. Snapshot the mount table first, from `/proc/self/mountinfo`.
2. Attempt to unmount every remaining non-root mount in the namespace —
   not only what peinit mounted, so the Phase 1 set is covered by
   construction.
3. Process in descending path depth, so children go before parents.
4. A mount point already gone is a successful no-op.
   [*graceful.a-mount-point-already-gone-is-a-no-op]
5. On failure, attempt a read-only remount. If that fails too, record it
   and continue. [*graceful.a-failed-unmount-falls-back-to-a-read-only-remount]
6. The root is never unmounted, but is remounted read-only at the end.
   [*graceful.the-root-is-remounted-read-only-never-unmounted] A
   failure there is recorded and does not stop step 8.

## Step 8: Sync and the final action

This step is irreversible. Cleanup failures retained from steps 6 and 7
affect diagnostics only and never block it.

1. `sync()`. Called on all three paths — graceful, forced and
   Critical reboot. [*graceful.sync-is-called-on-all-three-paths]
2. `reboot(2)` with `RB_POWER_OFF`, `RB_AUTOBOOT` or `RB_HALT_SYSTEM`.
   [*graceful.the-final-action-is-reboot2-with-the-kinds-command]
3. If `reboot(2)` returns, the final action failed. peinit enters a
   minimal failed-shutdown state, keeps PID 1 alive, records the
   failure, and retries the same action no more than once a second. It
   does not restart services and does not enter recovery mode —
   finalisation has begun and there is nothing to go back to.

## Shutdown during boot

A shutdown requested while Phase 2 is still running takes effect
immediately, through the same classification: Starting services are
SIGKILLed, services that reached Active are stopped gracefully, and the
boot is abandoned. [*graceful.a-shutdown-during-phase-2-takes-effect-immediately]
