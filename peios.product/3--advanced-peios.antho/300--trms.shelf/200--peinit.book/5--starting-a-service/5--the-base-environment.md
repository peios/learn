title: The Base Environment
description: Every service environment is built from scratch in four layers, lowest precedence first, with nothing inherited.
---

peinit constructs every service and hook process's environment from
scratch, in four layers, lowest precedence first. Nothing is inherited:
peinit's own startup environment holds `TERM` and nothing else (§2.1),
and none of it is passed through.

## Layer 1: the compiled-in base

One variable:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `PATH` | `/sbin:/bin` |

Executables are addressed through the root-level StrataFS runtime views.
Package storage paths under `/usr` are deliberately not on the default
search path.

## Layer 2: global environment variables

Each value under `Machine\System\Init\EnvVars\` becomes a variable: the
value name is the variable name, the `REG_SZ` data is the value. An
`EnvVars\PATH` overrides the compiled-in `PATH`; every other name adds.

A malformed entry — an empty name, or a name containing `=` — fails the
whole layer, which at boot means recovery mode.

**registryd does not receive this layer.** The exemption is a trust
rule, not an availability one. Write access to `EnvVars\` is equivalent
to compromising every service peinit starts: `LD_PRELOAD`,
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and their relatives are not filtered, because the
key's Security Descriptor is meant to be the control boundary. A key
that could inject into the daemon that enforces who may write it would
make that boundary self-referential.

The exemption is narrow, and matches on two things at once: the job's
resolved identity is `SYSTEM` and its service name is `registryd`. A
non-platform service that happens to be called `registryd` receives the
ordinary layering. It matches on the *job*, so a hook of registryd's
running under a non-SYSTEM `HookIdentity` would receive the layer; and
it matches the resolved identity string, so a definition naming
`S-1-5-18` literally rather than `SYSTEM` would not be exempt.

registryd is launched in Phase 1, before `EnvVars` has been read at all,
so the exemption is only observable on a restart.

## Layer 3: the service's own Environment

The definition's `Environment` entries, overriding both layers below.

## Layer 4: protocol variables

`NOTIFY_SOCKET`, always. `LISTEN_FDS`, `LISTEN_FDNAMES` and
`LISTEN_PID`, only when descriptors are being injected — from the fd
store for a service, or from a submission's attachments for a submitted
job (§8.5).

These have the highest precedence. The first three are inserted after
both configurable layers, and all four names are dropped from those
layers before insertion, so a service cannot override `NOTIFY_SOCKET`
and break its own notification protocol, and an `EnvVars\LISTEN_FDS=3`
cannot point an fd-store-less service's `sd_listen_fds` at whatever
happens to sit at descriptor 3. The name filter is what protects the
`LISTEN_*` set when it is *not* being set.

`LISTEN_PID`, which a conforming `sd_listen_fds` implementation checks
against its own PID before trusting `LISTEN_FDS`, is appended by the
child itself after the clone, because only then is the PID known; the
name filter keeps a configured value from shadowing it.

## What peinit does not set

Not `HOME`, `USER`, `LOGNAME`, `SHELL` or `TERM`. Peios identity is a
KACS token — a SID — rather than a passwd entry, so there is no
canonical home directory or login shell to populate. A service that
needs one supplies it through `EnvVars\` or its own `Environment`; a
submitted job's submitter supplies it in the submission's
`environment`, which occupies layer 3 for a job.

## Hooks and probes

Hooks, health checks and reload commands are built through the same
path, so they receive the identical environment: the same layers, the
same `NOTIFY_SOCKET`, and the service's `WorkingDirectory`,
`LimitNOFILE`, `LimitCORE` and `RequiredPrivileges`. They never receive
`LISTEN_FDS` — stored descriptors go to the main process only.

## When changes apply

The global layer is a snapshot refreshed at boot and on reload-config,
and both it and the per-service `Environment` take effect at a service's
next start. Neither is applied to a running process.
