description: The OnCalendar grammar peinit parses — component syntax, named shortcuts, timezones, daylight saving and precision.
---

A timer schedule is a calendar expression in systemd's `OnCalendar`
format. The grammar below is what peinit parses.

```
DayOfWeek Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second Timezone
```

Every field is optional, and which fields are present is worked out
positionally from their shape.
[*cal.fields-are-optional-and-identified-positionally]

| Field | Form | Default if omitted |
|---|---|---|
| DayOfWeek | weekday names | any day |
| Date | `Year-Month-Day` | `*-*-*` |
| Time | `Hour:Minute:Second` | `00:00:00` |
| Second | the `:Second` of Time | `:00` |
| Timezone | an IANA name | system-local |

A time-only expression such as `02:00:00` implies the date `*-*-*`.
[*cal.a-time-only-expression-implies-every-date]
`Hour:Minute` alone defaults the seconds to `00`.
[*cal.hour-minute-defaults-the-seconds-to-zero]

Years range 0–9999, months 1–12, days 1–31.
[*cal.numeric-components-have-fixed-ranges]

## Component syntax

Every numeric component, and the weekday, accepts:
[*cal.numeric-components-and-the-weekday-take-wildcards-lists-ranges-and-steps]

- **Wildcard** — `*` matches anything.
- **List** — comma-separated values: `1,15`.
- **Range** — two values around `..`, inclusive: `Mon..Fri`, `8..17`.
  A reversed range is a parse error rather than a wrap-around.
  [*cal.a-reversed-range-is-a-parse-error]
- **Repetition** — a value or range suffixed with `/` and a step.
  `value/step` matches the value and every multiple of the step above
  it, so `0/15` in the minute field is 0, 15, 30 and 45.
  `start..end/step` walks from start to end inclusive.
  [*cal.a-step-matches-every-multiple-above-its-start]

Weekdays are English names, case-insensitive, abbreviated or full, and
accept lists and ranges. [*cal.weekday-names-are-english-case-insensitive-and-abbreviable]
`Mon` and `Monday` are the same day, as are `Tue`, `Tues` and `Tuesday`.

## Last day of the month

A `~` in place of the `-` between Month and Day counts the day from the
**end** of the month: `~01` is the last day, `~02` the second-to-last,
and so on. [*cal.a-tilde-counts-the-day-from-the-end-of-the-month]
`*-*~01` is the last day of every month; `*-02~03` is the
third-to-last day of February.

Repetition combines with it, and steps in the day-of-month direction —
which means it walks the offset *downwards*, towards the end of the
month. [*cal.a-step-after-a-tilde-walks-the-offset-downwards]
`Mon *-05~07/1` covers the last seven days of May, and combined
with `Mon` resolves to exactly one day: the last Monday in May.

Wildcards, ranges and lists are also accepted after `~`, so `~*` matches
every day and `~03..07` the third- to seventh-to-last.
[*cal.wildcards-ranges-and-lists-are-accepted-after-a-tilde]

## Named shortcuts [*cal.the-named-shortcuts-expand-to-the-equivalent-expression]

| Shortcut | Equivalent |
|---|---|
| `minutely` | `*-*-* *:*:00` |
| `hourly` | `*-*-* *:00:00` |
| `daily` | `*-*-* 00:00:00` |
| `weekly` | `Mon *-*-* 00:00:00` |
| `monthly` | `*-*-01 00:00:00` |
| `quarterly` | `*-01,04,07,10-01 00:00:00` |
| `semiannually` | `*-01,07-01 00:00:00` |
| `yearly`, `annually` | `*-01-01 00:00:00` |

Shortcut names are case-insensitive and accept a trailing timezone, so
`daily UTC` is valid.
[*cal.shortcut-names-are-case-insensitive-and-take-a-trailing-timezone]

## Timezones

Timezone specifiers are IANA database names — `Europe/London`,
`US/Eastern`, `UTC`. An expression with no timezone is interpreted in
system-local time.
[*cal.a-timezone-is-an-iana-name-and-its-absence-means-system-local]

A name is validated when the expression is parsed and resolved again at
evaluation. An unrecognised zone is a hard parse error, not a silent
fallback to UTC. [*cal.an-unrecognised-timezone-is-a-parse-error]

## Daylight saving

- **Spring forward**, where the clock skips an hour: a scheduled time
  falling inside the skipped interval does not fire. peinit moves on to
  the next scheduled second, then the next date.
  [*cal.a-time-in-the-spring-forward-gap-does-not-fire]
  A schedule of `*-03-31 01:30 Europe/London` skips 2024 entirely.
- **Fall back**, where an hour repeats: a scheduled time inside the
  repeated interval fires exactly once, on the **first** occurrence.
  [*cal.a-time-in-the-repeated-hour-fires-once-on-the-first-occurrence]
  On re-arming, the same civil time resolves to the same instant, which
  is not later than the firing that just happened, so the timer advances
  to the next day rather than firing again.

## Precision

Second-level. Unlike systemd, peinit does not accept fractional seconds
— service scheduling has no use for finer granularity, and dropping it
keeps the parser simpler. A fraction anywhere in the time component is a
parse error. [*cal.a-fraction-in-the-time-component-is-a-parse-error]

## Examples

| Expression | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `*-*-* 02:00:00` | Every day at 2am, system-local. |
| `Mon *-*-* 00:00:00` | Every Monday at midnight. |
| `*-*-1,15 12:00:00` | The 1st and 15th, at noon. |
| `*-*~01 00:00:00` | The last day of each month, at midnight. |
| `Mon..Fri *-*-* 09:00:00` | Weekdays at 9am. |
| `*-*-* *:00/15:00` | Every fifteen minutes. |
| `*-*-* 02:00:00 Europe/London` | Every day at 2am London time. |

> [!NOTE]
> An expression that parses but can never match — `*-02-30`, or a fixed
> year already past — is not rejected at parse time.
> [*cal.an-unsatisfiable-expression-is-not-a-parse-error]
> Computing its next occurrence walks forward a day at a time for ten
> years and then gives up, reporting no future occurrence.
> [*cal.an-unsatisfiable-expression-is-walked-for-ten-years] The horizon
> is there because walking the full year range would turn an
> unsatisfiable schedule into a boot that hangs.
