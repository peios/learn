description: How a field's value must be written, as distinct from what it means — strings, identity, privileges, directories and environment.

Rules that apply to how a field's value is written, as distinct from
what it means.

## Strings

A string field that is present is non-empty, unless this section says
otherwise for that field. Three fields treat the empty string as
absence:

- `Identity` — empty is the same as absent, and defaults to
  `LocalService`.
- `HookIdentity` — empty is the same as absent, and falls back to the
  service's `Identity`.
- `DisplayName` and `Description` — empty is the same as absent.

`WorkingDirectory`, when present, is a non-empty absolute path. Whether
it exists, is a directory, and is reachable is checked when the service
starts, not when the definition is read.

`TTYPath` is checked for emptiness before absoluteness: an empty value
means no terminal, and a non-empty relative path is rejected.

## Identity and HookIdentity

Either a well-known principal name — `SYSTEM`, `LocalService`,
`NetworkService` — matched case-insensitively and canonicalised, or a
literal SID string such as `S-1-5-18`. Anything else is passed to authd
verbatim to resolve (§4.3).

## RequiredPrivileges

Privilege names, matched **case-sensitively** against the published
privilege table. A name that does not match exactly fails token
materialisation and therefore the service start, so `SeTCBPrivilege`
does not start a service that `SeTcbPrivilege` would.

## RuntimeDirectories

Each entry names one directory directly under `/run`. Entries are
non-empty relative names; an entry equal to `.` or `..` is rejected, as
is any entry containing `/`, `\`, a NUL, or a control character. A dot
inside a name is fine — `app.sock.d` is a valid entry.

For an entry `foo`, peinit creates `/run/foo` immediately before
launching the service's main process, with a descriptor granting full
access to SYSTEM, Administrators, and the service's own SID. Hook
processes inherit the service's environment and identity rules but do
not cause provisioning — the directories belong to the main start.

If creation or descriptor assignment fails, the start fails with
`ParentSetupFailure`.

peinit does not remove runtime directories when a service stops. `/run`
is a boot-scoped tmpfs and the next boot clears it.

## Environment

Each entry is `KEY=VALUE`, with a non-empty key containing no NUL. An
entry that does not split into that shape is a decode error.

## SuccessExitCodes

Each entry is a decimal integer from 0 to 255 — a process exit code.
Signal names and ranges are not accepted. Code 0 is always success and
does not need listing. Duplicates are collapsed.

## Dependency and handler names

Entries in `Requires`, `Wants`, `BindsTo` and `Conflicts`, and the
value of `OnFailure`, are validated as service names when the definition
is read. A dependency naming something outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` is a
decode error rather than an unresolved dependency discovered later —
the difference being that a typo containing an illegal character is
caught immediately, while a typo that is still a legal name is caught at
graph validation as a missing target.

## Timeouts and intervals

Every timeout and interval in the schema is in whole seconds unless the
field says otherwise. The two `sd_notify` fields that carry durations,
`WATCHDOG_USEC` and `EXTEND_TIMEOUT_USEC`, are in microseconds because
that is what the protocol specifies.

## Identifiers peinit generates

Job identifiers, operation identifiers, and every other GUID peinit
mints are UUIDv7. UUIDv7 is time-ordered, so identifiers sort by
creation time — which is what keeps eventd's time-range and recency
queries over jobs and operations cheap.
