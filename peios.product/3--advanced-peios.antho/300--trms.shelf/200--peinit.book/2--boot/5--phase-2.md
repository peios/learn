title: Phase 2
description: The registry-driven phase — reading the definitions, building and validating the graph, starting it, and deciding the boot succeeded.
---

With registryd serving, peinit reads the service graph and boots the
system from it. Phase 2 is entirely registry-driven.

## Reading the definitions

peinit reads every key under `Machine\System\Services\`. The reads are
bounded by LCS's request timeout: if registryd hangs mid-read, peinit
receives `ETIMEDOUT` and enters recovery.

Decoding is per key. A definition that fails to decode — an invalid
service name, a malformed trigger, an unclosed quote in a command, a
`registry:` check naming an uncacheable key, a duplicate known field, an
unrecognised value for an enumerated dword — fails that service, which
is marked Failed with cause `ValidationError`. The boot proceeds with
every other definition, and anything that depended on the failed service
fails in turn through the ordinary dependency propagation.

Only services carrying a `boot` trigger are root candidates. A service
with no triggers is demand-only and is not a root, though it can still
be pulled into the boot transaction as somebody's dependency. A service
with `Disabled=1` is excluded from the boot graph entirely, but its
definition is still loaded into the in-memory model so it can be started
by hand later.

## Building and validating the graph

The boot graph is every boot-triggered root candidate plus the
transitive closure of their `Requires`, `BindsTo`, and existing
non-disabled `Wants` dependencies. `Requires` and `BindsTo` pull their
target in even if the target has no `boot` trigger. `Wants` targets come
in as best-effort members; missing or disabled ones are ignored. A
missing or disabled `Requires` or `BindsTo` target blocks the dependent
with cause `DependencyFailure`, and that blocking propagates.

peinit topologically sorts the graph and validates it before starting
anything. The rules are in §7.2; the outcomes that matter here are:

- **A cycle** fails every service in it. A cycle involving a Critical
  service downgrades the boot to Safe mode without rebooting.
- **An unresolvable conflict** fails both services. Same downgrade if
  either is Critical.
- **A missing `Requires` target** fails the dependent.
- **Warnings** — a `Readiness=Alive` service with dependents that
  require it — are logged and do not prevent boot.

## Starting

peinit walks the graph and starts services, parallelising wherever the
graph allows, up to a configurable limit:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Machine\System\Boot\MaxParallelStarts` | 10 | Services starting concurrently. |

An absent key uses the default. A value of zero, a type mismatch, or a
malformed payload is invalid boot configuration and sends peinit to
recovery — running the scheduler with an effective limit of zero would
hang the boot rather than fail it.

As each service reaches a dependent-satisfying state — Active for
Simple, Completed for Oneshot with or without `RemainAfterExit`, Skipped
for a service whose conditions did not hold — its dependents become
eligible and join the start queue. A Oneshot without `RemainAfterExit`
passes through Completed, releasing its dependents, and then goes
Inactive.

Dependents blocked on a `Requires` or `BindsTo` target wait for that
target to reach a satisfying state. Dependents blocked on a `Wants`
target wait only for it to reach *any* terminal state, satisfying or
not — which is what makes `Wants` ordering rather than dependency.

### The typical order

Nothing below is hardcoded. It falls out of the dependency graph that
the standard role definitions produce, and an administrator who changes
a dependency gets a different order.

1. **eudev** — device management. SYSTEM, with `RequiredPrivileges`
   stripped to the minimum it needs. Starts before authd exists.
2. **lpsd** — the local identity database. Depends only on registryd.
3. **authd** — the identity authority. Depends on registryd and lpsd.
   Once it is ready, token minting is available.
4. **eventd** — logging and audit. Services started before it log into
   peinit's pre-eventd buffer.
5. **Networking** — the first service to receive a token from authd.
6. **Application services**, in dependency order.
7. **Login services**, last, so the system is operational before it
   accepts a session.

### The bootstrap matrix

| Service | Phase | Identity | Token from | Readiness | ErrorControl |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| registryd | 1 | SYSTEM | minted by peinit | Notify | Critical |
| eudev | 2 | SYSTEM | minted by peinit, privileges stripped | Alive | Normal |
| lpsd | 2 | SYSTEM | minted by peinit | Notify | Critical |
| authd | 2 | SYSTEM | minted by peinit | Notify | Critical |
| eventd | 2 | SYSTEM | minted by peinit | Notify | Critical |
| networking | 2 | service token | authd | Notify | Normal |
| sshd | 2 | service token | authd | Alive | Normal |
| application services | 2 | service token | authd | per-service | Normal |

## Deferred starts

A service whose trigger is `boot:settled` is not part of the boot plan
at all. It is not a root, it does not consume the parallel-start budget,
it is not counted towards boot success, and it cannot block or delay
anything. peinit starts it after the plan, once the boot has stopped
moving.

"Stopped moving" is precise: every service in the plan — those that were
started and those that were blocked — is in a state it will not leave
without help. Active, Completed, Failed, Skipped, Abandoned and Inactive
all count as settled. Starting, Reloading, Stopping and **Backoff** do
not, because a service between restart attempts is going to produce more
output.

A deadline bounds the wait:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Machine\System\Boot\SettleTimeout` | 5 | Seconds before deferred services start regardless. |

The deadline is measured from the moment the plan was observed. An
absent key uses the default; a type mismatch or a bad length sends
peinit to recovery. Zero is legal and means "start on the next turn,
settled or not".

Whichever comes first — the set settling or the deadline expiring — the
deferred services start, once, each independently. A start that fails is
recorded and dropped: one refusing service does not stop the others and
does not affect the boot. The dispatch carries a flag saying whether the
deadline expired rather than the set settling, so a service that cares
whether the boot was still moving can be told.

## Boot success

A boot is successful once every Critical service has held a
dependent-satisfying state continuously for a grace period:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Machine\System\Boot\BootSuccessGrace` | 30 | Seconds of held health before the boot counts. |

The criterion is *satisfying*, not Active. A Critical Oneshot reaches
Completed and never reaches Active, so a test for Active would make such
a service unable to ever mark a boot successful. Skipped counts too.

Success resets the boot attempt counter to zero (§2.7).

## Failure summary

| Failure | Response |
|---|---|
| A service definition fails to decode | Recovery |
| A registry read times out | Recovery |
| Invalid `MaxParallelStarts` or `SettleTimeout` | Recovery |
| A dependency cycle | All services in it Failed; Safe mode if any is Critical (see below) |
| An unresolvable conflict | Both Failed; Safe mode if either is Critical (see below) |
| A missing `Requires` target | The dependent Failed |
| A Critical service fails during boot | Restart budget, then reboot |
| A non-Critical service fails | Failed; its `Requires` dependents fail; the rest continue |
| authd unavailable when a service needs a token | That service Failed |

The two Safe-mode rows carry a caveat. When the downgrade fires, peinit
rebuilds the graph in Safe mode and discards the Full-mode one, so the
services that caused it are **not** marked Failed — they are never
entered into the blocked set at all. What records them is the boot-level
downgrade finding described in [Boot modes](~peios/boot/boot-modes).
