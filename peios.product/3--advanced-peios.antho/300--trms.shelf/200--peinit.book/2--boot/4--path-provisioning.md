title: Path Provisioning
description: Filesystem objects belonging to no single service — how entries are declared, what descriptors they get, and what failure does.
---

Some filesystem objects belong to no single service. A directory two
packages both write into, a state file created before anything runs, a
path that has to exist with a particular Security Descriptor before the
first service that uses it starts — none of these has an owner in the
service model, and creating them from a service's pre-exec hook makes
their existence depend on start ordering.

Boot-time path provisioning is the registry-backed answer, and the
equivalent of the tmpfiles.d role elsewhere. peinit applies it after
registryd is serving and before any Phase 2 service is planned or
started.

## Entries

Each child key under `Machine\System\Init\ProvisionedPaths\` is one
entry. Unknown values on an entry are ignored.

| Value | Type | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Kind` | string | yes | — | `directory` or `file`. |
| `Path` | string | yes | — | Absolute path to create or verify. |
| `Security` | binary | no | built-in | The Peios file Security Descriptor to apply. |
| `Required` | dword | no | 0 | If 1, failing this entry prevents Phase 2. |

For `Kind=directory` peinit ensures the path exists as a directory; for
`Kind=file` it ensures the path exists as a regular file. In either case
a path that exists with a different file type fails the entry. An
existing file is opened rather than created, so provisioning never
truncates one.

peinit does not create parent directories. The parent is checked, and has
to already be a directory. A package that needs a hierarchy declares
each directory explicitly, or depends on the package that owns the
parent — which keeps the ownership of every directory traceable to a
package rather than to whichever entry happened to run first.

## Descriptors

When `Security` is present, peinit applies the supplied binary
descriptor. A malformed or rejected descriptor fails the entry.

When it is absent, peinit applies a built-in default:

```
O:SY G:SY D:(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GA;;;BA)(A;;FR;;;BU)
```

SYSTEM and Administrators get full control; ordinary users get
`FILE_GENERIC_READ`.

## Failure

Entries with `Required=0` are fail-soft: peinit logs and continues.
Entries with `Required=1` are fail-closed: peinit logs and enters
recovery before Phase 2 starts.

An entry that is malformed — a missing or unrecognised `Kind`, a missing
or relative `Path`, a value of the wrong type — is logged as a warning
and skipped, regardless of `Required`. `Required` marks a path as
essential to boot; it does not make a broken entry more dangerous than a
missing one.
