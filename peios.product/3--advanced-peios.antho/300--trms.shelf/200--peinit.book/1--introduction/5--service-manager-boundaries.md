These design notes explain the boundaries behind the [operator workflows](~peios/services-and-jobs/overview). The implementation chapters specify each mechanism in detail.

## peinit in one sentence

**peinit is the sole service manager and PID 1 — it reads service definitions from the registry, starts them in dependency order under per-service identities, supervises them through a defined state machine, and tears them down in reverse at shutdown.**

Everything in this topic is an elaboration of that sentence: what a *service definition* is, what *dependency order* means, what the *state machine* looks like, how *identity* is materialised, and how you drive the whole thing from a shell.

## Three kinds of object

peinit is easiest to understand through the three first-class objects it works with. Keeping them straight is most of the battle when you read a status output or an event log.

| Object | What it is | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| **Service** | A *definition* — a named unit of execution with identity, policy, and configuration, stored in the registry. It has a runtime state (the [state machine](~peios/services-and-jobs/the-service-lifecycle)) and, when running, a process. | Long-lived. Persists across restarts and reboots. |
| **Job** | A single *process execution*. Every time peinit forks — a service's main process, a hook, a health check, a submitted job — that is one job, with its own GUID and exit result. | Short-lived. A restart creates a *new* job. |
| **Operation** | A *requested action* on a service — start, stop, restart, reload, reset. Control commands create operations that are validated, queued, and executed. | Short-lived. Resolves to a terminal state, then is dropped. |

A service is the *what*; a job is *what actually ran*; an operation is *what someone asked for*. A single `restart` command, for example, is one **operation**, which stops the current **job** and starts a new one, all against one **service**. Jobs and operations both carry GUIDs and are emitted to [eventd](~peios/auditing/overview) as they complete, which is how the history of a service is reconstructed after the fact. They get their own page: [Jobs and operations](~peios/services-and-jobs/jobs-and-operations).

Underneath all three sits the fourth thing peinit is always handling — the **token**, the identity a service runs under. Tokens are not peinit's invention; they are the [system-wide identity object](~peios/tokens/overview). peinit's role is to obtain the right token for each service and install it before the process runs. That is the subject of [Service identity and privileges](~peios/services-and-jobs/identity-and-privileges).

## What peinit is not

peinit borrows vocabulary from init systems you may already know, and the familiarity is a trap. Clearing three wrong mental models is most of understanding what peinit actually is.

**It is not systemd.** There are no unit files. peinit does not read, parse, or translate `.service` files, and there is no migration shim. A service definition is a key in the [registry](~peios/registry-concepts/overview) under `Machine\System\Services\`, made of typed registry values — not a text file under `/etc`. Some *interfaces* are deliberately compatible where that helps: peinit speaks the `sd_notify` readiness protocol, and timer schedules use systemd's `OnCalendar` calendar-expression format. The compatibility stops at those wire formats; the model underneath is different.

**It is not Windows SCM.** The influence is real — services as securable objects with per-service descriptors, token-based service identity, an access-controlled control interface, a structured state machine — but it is *architectural*, not interface-level. peinit does not implement the SCM RPC protocol, Windows service types, or Windows control codes.

**It is not a logging system.** peinit holds a service's `stdout`/`stderr` pipes at birth, so it controls *where* output goes — but storage, indexing, and queries are [eventd](~peios/auditing/overview)'s job. peinit forwards; eventd is the historian. The same split applies to job and operation history: peinit emits structured events and forgets them; eventd keeps them. See [Service output and logging](~peios/services-and-jobs/output-and-logging).

A fourth, smaller correction: **peinit does not supervise forking daemons.** A service that double-forks to "daemonise" is solving a problem that does not exist when the manager tracks the process it spawned. peinit tracks every process by [pidfd](~peios/services-and-jobs/service-types); a legacy binary that insists on double-forking must be wrapped at the package layer.

## The one operational invariant

peinit is **single-threaded PID 1**, and that one fact explains a surprising amount of its design. In a single-threaded PID 1, a blocking system call blocks *everything* — child reaping, watchdog expiry, shutdown signals, every other event stops while the call is stuck. So peinit's hard rule is that **its event loop never blocks on a userspace service.**

Two consequences you will meet repeatedly:

- **peinit operates on an in-memory snapshot of the registry, not a live view.** It reads service definitions at boot and on configuration reload, and thereafter works from an in-memory model that it updates from [change notifications](~peios/registry-concepts/watches). Supervision never waits on the registry being available. This is why a configuration change does not always take effect immediately — see [Defining a service](~peios/services-and-jobs/defining-a-service).
- **Anything that could block is pushed off the main loop.** Filesystem condition checks run in a short-lived forked helper rather than a `stat()` on the event loop; token requests to authd are driven by a timed state machine, not a blocking call; log delivery is best-effort and never exerts back-pressure on peinit.

You do not need to think about the event loop to operate peinit, but it is the reason behind several behaviours that would otherwise look arbitrary.

## Where peinit sits in the system

peinit is part of the [Trusted Computing Base](~peios/boot-and-trust-establishment/overview): a compromise of peinit is a compromise of the whole machine. It runs as [SYSTEM](~peios/identity/well-known-principals) with all privileges, and it never drops that identity. It depends on, and is depended on by, the other TCB components:

| peinit relies on | For |
|---|---|
| **KACS** | Service identity (installing tokens on children), control-interface authentication (peer token + AccessCheck), and per-service access control. See [Access decisions](~peios/access-decisions/overview). |
| **LCS / the registry** | Service definitions, boot configuration, and its own parameters. See [The registry](~peios/registry-concepts/overview). |
| **registryd** | The registry *source* daemon — the first service peinit starts. peinit treats it as an opaque dependency. (`registryd` is an interface; the default implementation is `loregd` — see [Boot and boot modes](~peios/services-and-jobs/boot-and-boot-modes).) |
| **authd** | Minting tokens for non-platform services. peinit requests; authd mints. |
| **eventd** | Service logs (forwarded over a socket) and job/operation/audit events (emitted through KMES). |
| **KACS, again** | Conveying a job identity: when a process submits a job over peinit's jobs socket and attaches a token, the kernel gates the attach — so peinit can run a program as a service's client without ever judging the identity itself. See [Jobs and operations](~peios/services-and-jobs/jobs-and-operations). |

The bootstrapping puzzle — authd needs the registry, the registry needs to be started by *something*, and that something is peinit running before any of them exist — is resolved by the boot model in [Boot and boot modes](~peios/services-and-jobs/boot-and-boot-modes).

## How a token is materialised

The `Identity` field decides where the token comes from:

| `Identity` value | Token source |
|---|---|
| `SYSTEM` | **Minted by peinit** from its own SYSTEM identity. |
| Any other principal name or SID | **Requested from [authd](~peios/boot-and-trust-establishment/authd-handoff).** |
| Absent or empty | authd, defaulting to `LocalService`. |

### The SYSTEM path

For a `SYSTEM` service, peinit mints an independent SYSTEM token using its own token as the template: it reads its own identity (user SID `S-1-5-18`, the group list, the privilege set) and mints a fresh primary token with the same identity, adding the service's [per-service SID](#the-per-service-sid). The minted token is fully independent — the [privilege trimming](~peios/services-and-jobs/identity-and-privileges#privilege-restriction) that follows affects only this token, never peinit's.

This path exists because of a bootstrapping problem: the platform services that *make* the normal token flow possible cannot use it, because they have to start *before* it exists. `registryd` and `authd` use this bootstrap path during [boot](~peios/services-and-jobs/boot-and-boot-modes). Standard eventd and lpsd deployments now use `Identity=Service`, take the authd path, and start after authd (§4.2).

> [!NOTE]
> There is no allow-list restricting which services *may* be `SYSTEM`. The security boundary is the [registry key descriptor](~peios/services-and-jobs/who-can-manage-a-service) on `Machine\System\Services\` — an administrator who can create service definitions is already trusted to assign any identity, so a second gate would add nothing. The dangerous case is never *implicit*, though: `SYSTEM` must be written out explicitly; an empty `Identity` defaults to the minimal `LocalService`, never to SYSTEM.

### The authd path

For any other identity, peinit asks [authd](~peios/boot-and-trust-establishment/authd-handoff) for a token: it sends the `Identity` value verbatim, and authd routes it to the right source —

- **Well-known principals** (`LocalService`, `NetworkService`, …) → a built-in identity with a predefined minimal privilege set;
- **Local service accounts** → [lpsd](~peios/identity/overview), the local principal store;
- **Domain accounts** → the directory connector;

— resolves the principal's SIDs, mints a token, creates a logon session, and hands the token back to peinit to install. peinit neither knows nor cares whether the identity is local or domain; routing is authd's job.

authd records each request as an `authd.service.attested` event: the service (`object.service.name`), the identity it got (`object.token.sid`), its session and the privileges policy granted it. A refused request is recorded too, with the reason, such as `account-restricted` for an identity that may not be used for a service logon. The event is standard, so the emission policy can switch it off on a machine that restarts services often.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Every non-SYSTEM service start depends on authd. peinit interacts with it over a non-blocking, timed channel — if authd is unreachable or unresponsive, the service start *fails* rather than hanging PID 1. A broken authd therefore prevents non-SYSTEM service starts, including any platform service configured that way, while SYSTEM-minted services do not need this request. The authd interface is `ServiceAttest` on `/run/logon.sock`, specified in PGSS §2.19 and used through libauthd (§4.3).

## The per-service SID

Every service token — minted or authd-issued — carries a **per-service SID** in its group list. It uses authority `S-1-5-80` and is derived deterministically from the service name: the SHA-1 of the uppercased name (as UTF-16LE), with the digest split into five sub-authorities. authd adds it automatically for the tokens it mints; peinit computes and adds it itself for SYSTEM tokens, no authd involvement needed.

The point of the per-service SID is **fine-grained access control even when services share an identity.** A dozen services might all run as `LocalService`, but each has a *unique* service SID, so an ACL can grant access to exactly one of them without inventing a dedicated account. It also keeps services configured as SYSTEM distinguishable to [AccessCheck](~peios/access-decisions/overview). See [Well-known principals](~peios/identity/well-known-principals) for the SID landscape this fits into.

## A clean context

A service inherits **only** what peinit explicitly hands it — its standard streams and any [stored file descriptors](~peios/services-and-jobs/execution-environment#the-fd-store). Every other descriptor peinit holds — the control socket, the notify socket, the event-loop fd, the registry and authd and eventd connections — is opened close-on-exec, so it closes automatically at exec and can never leak into a service. peinit also resets the child's signal state to defaults (it runs with all signals blocked for its own [signalfd](~peios/services-and-jobs/shutdown); a service must not inherit that). The guarantee is that a service starts from a clean slate, not from peinit's privileged one.

## The cgroup tree

Every service runs in its own [cgroup](~peios/threads-and-processes/process-lifecycle) tree under `/sys/fs/cgroup/peinit/`, with separate sub-cgroups for the main process, hooks, and health checks:

```
/sys/fs/cgroup/peinit/<service>/
                       ├── main/     the main process
                       ├── hooks/    pre/post hooks
                       └── health/   health checks
```

peinit uses cgroups for two things only: **tracking** every process a service spawns (so a child that forks its own children is still accounted to the service), and **clean kill** (terminating the entire tree at once, so nothing is orphaned). It does *not* use cgroups for resource accounting or limits.

The split into sub-cgroups serves a real purpose: it satisfies cgroup v2's "no internal processes" rule, and it lets peinit kill a service's *hooks* or *health checks* without touching the main process.

When an old tree cannot be removed — because a process survived SIGKILL in [D-state](~peios/services-and-jobs/the-service-lifecycle) and leaked it — peinit creates a fresh **generational** tree (`<service>.gen<N>`) for the next start, so a stuck old instance never blocks a new one. Leaks are surfaced in the service's `warnings`; they are a sign of an underlying I/O fault, covered in [Keeping services running](~peios/services-and-jobs/supervision).
