title: Single-Label Expansion
description: Which search domains resolvd applies to a single-label name, in what order, how the candidates are built and asked, and what never gets expanded.
---

PSPU §6.7 sets the search expansion rules. This article is how resolvd
builds and asks the list of candidates.

## What counts as a single label

A name is single-label when it parses to exactly one label. The trailing
dot plays no part: `printer.` is single-label and is expanded exactly as
`printer` is. [*engine-expansion.trailing-dot-does-not-suppress-expansion] A top-level domain such as `com` is a single label too,
and cannot be asked for directly. [*engine-expansion.top-level-domain-cannot-be-asked]

A multi-label name has one candidate, itself. [*engine-expansion.multi-label-single-candidate]

## The applicable domains

| When | Domains, in order |
|---|---|
| An exclusive scope is up | That scope's search domains, and nothing else [*engine-expansion.exclusive-scope-domains-only] |
| Otherwise | The search domains of every up scope, scopes ordered by metric, then `ExtraSearchDomains` [*engine-expansion.up-scope-domains-then-extra] |

The exclusive scope is the one routing would choose (§4.4). Up scopes
are those at `link` or better with at least one server; a scope that
has search domains and no servers contributes none of them. [*engine-expansion.scope-without-servers-contributes-no-domains] Scopes with
equal metrics keep their snapshot order, and each scope's domains keep
their own order. `ExtraSearchDomains` is not applied while an exclusive
scope is up. [*engine-expansion.extra-domains-ignored-under-exclusive]

## Building the candidates

Each domain in turn is appended to the label. A candidate already in the
list is not added again, [*engine-expansion.duplicate-candidates-removed] and a candidate longer than 255 bytes on the
wire is left out. [*engine-expansion.overlong-candidates-left-out] With no candidates left the name is `notfound` without
a query (§4.1).

A candidate keeps the case of the label as asked and of the domain as
configured; that is the case its records are reported at (§4.8). [*engine-expansion.candidate-case-preserved]

## Asking them

Candidates are asked one at a time, in order. [*engine-expansion.candidates-asked-one-at-a-time] Each is routed on its own
(§4.4) and has its own attempt budget (§4.6). A `notfound` — from a
server or from the cache — moves to the next candidate. The first
candidate that is anything else ends the question:

- `found`, with records or without, is the answer, and later candidates
  are not asked; [*engine-expansion.found-or-nodata-ends-expansion]
- `unavailable` is the answer, and later candidates are not asked. [*engine-expansion.unavailable-ends-expansion]

When the last candidate is `notfound`, the question is `notfound`
(§4.1).
