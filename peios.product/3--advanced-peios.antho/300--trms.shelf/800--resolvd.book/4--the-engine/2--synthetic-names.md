title: Synthetic Names
description: The names resolvd answers before any network — localhost, the static names, the machine's own name, .local, and their reverses — in the order it checks them and for which record types.
---

PSPU §6.7 lists the names a resolver answers before any network.
resolvd checks them in a fixed order, on the name as asked and before
any search expansion, and the first match answers the task.

## The order

1. **`localhost`, or any name under it.** `127.0.0.1` for `A`, `::1`
   for `AAAA`, both for `ANY`. Source `synthetic`. [*engine-synthetic.localhost]
2. **A static name.** An exact, case-insensitive match against the
   `Hosts\` values (§2.3). The name's addresses of the asked family —
   IPv4 for `A`, IPv6 for `AAAA`, both for `ANY`. Source `hosts`. [*engine-synthetic.static-name]
3. **The machine's hostname.** An exact, case-insensitive match against
   the hostname (§3.3), answered with the machine's own addresses
   (below). Source `synthetic`. [*engine-synthetic.hostname]
4. **`.local`.** The name `local` or any name under it is `notfound`,
   whatever the type asked. Source `synthetic`. No query is sent. [*engine-synthetic.local-is-notfound]
5. **A reverse-mapping name, for `PTR` or `ANY` only.** See below.

A name that matches none of these goes on to search expansion and the
network.

### Static names beat the hostname and `.local` [*engine-synthetic.check-order]

Because the order is fixed, a static name beats the hostname and
`.local`: a `Hosts\` value named `printer.local` is answered with its
addresses, and one named after the machine overrides the machine's own
addresses.

### `localhost` beats a static name [*engine-synthetic.static-name-under-localhost-unused]

`localhost` is checked first, so a `Hosts\` value named `localhost`, or
a name under it such as `printer.localhost`, never answers a forward
question: the synthetic loopback answer is given instead. Its addresses
still answer reverse questions through the static-name row below,
except loopback addresses, which the loopback row takes first.

### Record types [*engine-synthetic.other-types-are-empty-found]

For the three address-bearing kinds, the answer is `found` whatever type
was asked; a type other than `A`, `AAAA` or `ANY`, or a family the name
has no address in, gives `found` with no records. `localhost` asked for
`MX` is an empty `found`, not a `notfound`, and is not forwarded.

### The machine's own addresses

- They are every address of every scope at `addressed` or better,
  whether or not the scope has servers, in snapshot order, link-local
  addresses included and loopback addresses excluded. [*engine-synthetic.own-addresses-from-every-addressed-scope]
- Repeated addresses are removed only when they are adjacent in that
  list, so an address on two interfaces that are not consecutive in the
  snapshot appears twice. [*engine-synthetic.only-adjacent-duplicates-removed]
- When there are none, the hostname is answered with `127.0.0.1` and
  `::1`. [*engine-synthetic.hostname-without-addresses-is-loopback]

## Reverse names

### Reverse-mapping names [*engine-synthetic.reverse-name-forms]

A reverse-mapping name is one under `in-addr.arpa` with exactly four
labels before the suffix, or one under `ip6.arpa` with exactly 32. The
suffix is matched case-insensitively.

- Each `in-addr.arpa` label parses as a decimal number from 0 to 255.
  Leading zeros and a leading `+` are accepted, so `1.0.0.0127.in-addr.arpa`
  and `+1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa` both name `127.0.0.1`.
- Each `ip6.arpa` label is a single hexadecimal digit, in either case.

A name of either shape whose labels do not parse is not a
reverse-mapping name.

### Synthetic reverse answers

Asked for `PTR` or `ANY`, a reverse-mapping name is answered
synthetically when its address is:

| Address | Answer | Source |
|---|---|---|
| A loopback address — anything in `127.0.0.0/8`, or `::1` | `PTR localhost` | `synthetic` [*engine-synthetic.reverse-loopback] |
| Listed under a static name | `PTR` that name | `hosts` [*engine-synthetic.reverse-static-name] |
| One of the machine's own addresses, when there is a hostname | `PTR` the hostname | `synthetic` [*engine-synthetic.reverse-own-address] |

The rows are tried in that order.

### An address shared by static names [*engine-synthetic.shared-static-address-reverse-per-configuration]

When several static names list the same address, the name returned is
whichever of them comes first in the iteration order of resolvd's
static-name table. That order is fixed while one configuration is in
use, so every reverse question for the address gets the same name until
the configuration next changes. A configuration change (§2.3) — to any
value, not only `Hosts\` — or a restart builds the table afresh, and can
then return another of them.

### Other reverse questions [*engine-synthetic.other-reverse-questions-go-to-network]

A reverse name asked for any other type, and a reverse name whose
address matches none of the rows, goes to the network.

## Properties of every synthetic answer

- Every synthetic record has TTL 0. [*engine-synthetic.ttl-zero]
- Synthetic answers are never cached, and the `no_cache` flag has no
  effect on them. [*engine-synthetic.never-cached]
- Each one adds one to the `synthetic` counter (§4.10).

## Expanded candidates are not checked [*engine-synthetic.expanded-candidates-not-checked]

Only the name as asked is checked. An expanded candidate is never
compared with the synthetic names, so with a static name `printer.lan`
and the search domain `lan`, a question for `printer` is expanded and
sent to the network as `printer.lan`.
