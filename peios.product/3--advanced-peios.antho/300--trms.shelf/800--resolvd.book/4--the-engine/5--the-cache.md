title: The Cache
description: What resolvd caches and for how long, the key, the capacity and how entries are evicted, what a hit reports, and every event that flushes it.
---

The cache's key and lifetimes are set by PSPU §6.7. This article is how
resolvd computes them and what it does at the edges.

## The cache key

- An entry is keyed by the candidate in lower case, the record type, and
  the scope key (§1.3). The class is not part of the key; every question
  resolvd asks is class `IN`. [*engine-cache.key-is-lowercase-candidate-type-scope]
- The same name asked through two scopes is two entries, and a single
  label's expansions are each cached under the expanded name. [*engine-cache.expansions-cached-under-expanded-name]

## What is stored

Only replies a server sent with response code `NOERROR` or `NXDOMAIN`
are stored, under the candidate and the scope the candidate was routed
to:

| Reply | Stored as | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| `NOERROR` with answer records of class `IN` | `found` with those records | The least TTL among those records, capped at 86 400 s [*engine-cache.positive-lifetime] |
| `NOERROR` with no answer records of class `IN` | `found` with none | Negative lifetime [*engine-cache.nodata-uses-negative-lifetime] |
| `NXDOMAIN` | `notfound` | Negative lifetime [*engine-cache.nxdomain-uses-negative-lifetime] |

### The negative lifetime

- The negative lifetime comes from the first `SOA` record in the reply's
  authority section: the lesser of its `MINIMUM` field and its own TTL,
  capped at 300 s. [*engine-cache.negative-lifetime-from-soa]
- A reply with no `SOA` in its authority section has a negative
  lifetime of zero. [*engine-cache.no-soa-negative-lifetime-zero]

### A zero lifetime is not stored [*engine-cache.zero-lifetime-not-stored]

An entry whose lifetime is zero is not stored. A positive answer with a
zero TTL, and a negative answer without an `SOA`, are therefore never
cached.

### What is never stored [*engine-cache.never-stored]

Never stored: synthetic answers, `unavailable`, transport failures, a
UDP reply with `TC` set (the reply to its TCP retry is the one
considered), and
replies with any other response code.

### The TTLs inside an entry [*engine-cache.record-ttls-kept-entry-lifetime-capped]

The records in an entry are kept with the TTLs the server sent. Only the
entry's lifetime is capped.

## Hits

- An entry is live while its expiry is in the future. A live entry is
  returned with each record's TTL lowered to the whole number of seconds
  the entry has left, rounded down, when that is less than the record's
  own. [*engine-cache.hit-ttl-lowered-to-remaining-seconds]
- A `notfound` hit with further candidates waiting moves to the next
  candidate, as a `notfound` from a server would (§4.1).

## Bypassing the cache

- A `resolve` request with `no_cache` set skips the lookup for each of
  its candidates. The reply it gets is still stored. [*engine-cache.no-cache-skips-lookup-still-stores]
- Stub queries, `lookup` and `reverse` always consult the cache. [*engine-cache.other-doors-always-consult-cache]

## Capacity and eviction

- The cache holds at most 8 192 entries. [*engine-cache.capacity]
- Expired entries are not removed when they expire; they stay until
  they are overwritten by a fresh answer for the same key, flushed, or
  evicted. The `cache_entries` count in `status` includes them. [*engine-cache.expired-entries-linger-and-are-counted]

### Eviction

Storing an entry under a key the cache does not already hold, when it
already holds 8 192 entries, first evicts:

1. every entry whose expiry is one second or more earlier than the new
   entry's expiry, live or not; [*engine-cache.eviction-sweeps-against-new-expiry]
2. then, if the cache still holds 8 192 entries, the one entry with the
   earliest expiry — any one of them, when several share it. [*engine-cache.eviction-then-earliest-expiry]

### A long-lived entry can empty a full cache [*engine-cache.long-lived-entry-empties-full-cache]

The first step compares against the new entry's expiry, not the current
time. A long-lived entry arriving at a full cache therefore evicts every
entry due to expire at least a second before it: a positive answer with
a day-long TTL arriving at a full cache of shorter-lived answers empties
it.

### Overwriting a held key [*engine-cache.overwrite-evicts-nothing]

Storing under a key the cache already holds replaces that entry, live
or expired, and evicts nothing else.

## Flushes

| Event | Discards |
|---|---|
| A snapshot in which a scope is new, has a different server list, or is missing (§3.3) | That scope's entries |
| A registry change to `FallbackServers` in content or order (§2.3) | The fallback scope's entries |
| A `flush` request (§5.3) | Everything |
| A restart | Everything |

Nothing else discards entries. Changes to static names, search domains,
the hostname, `ControlSecurity`, scope flags and metrics leave the cache
as it is.

### A reply after its scope was flushed [*engine-cache.late-reply-stored-after-flush]

In [source `b4f7085`](https://github.com/peios/resolvd/blob/b4f70857729069952762f8e2a2b56357b15d4760/resolvd/src/engine.rs),
a reply that arrives after its scope was flushed is still stored, under
the same scope key.

### Proposed admission rule for invalidated tasks [*engine-cache.invalidated-task-does-not-store]

The [proposed source correction](https://github.com/peios/resolvd/blob/bc4efa36dd72a942169e4d5ad849f5806a4fd7f1/resolvd/src/engine.rs)
also invalidates pending tasks' permission to store answers. A global
`flush` affects every pending task. Removing an interface scope or
changing its server list affects tasks currently associated with that
scope; changing the fallback-server list affects tasks associated with
the fallback scope.

An invalidated task still completes its original requester normally,
but cannot store any further answers. This restriction persists through
UDP-to-TCP fallback, timeout retries and later search candidates, even
if a later attempt uses a new server list. Removing and re-adding a
scope does not restore the task's permission. Fresh requests can cache
normally.

Changes only to metrics, search domains or other scope properties with
unchanged server lists do not invalidate admission; unrelated scopes'
pending tasks are unaffected. This changes cache admission, not request
cancellation or routing. Cache keys, TTLs and eviction policy are
unchanged. It describes proposed source behavior, not a released package
or an installed resolver; check the installed source revision before
relying on it.
