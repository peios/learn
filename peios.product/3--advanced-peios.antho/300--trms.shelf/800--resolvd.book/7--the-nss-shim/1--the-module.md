title: The Module
description: libnss_peios_net.so.2 as built — what it links, how each call talks to resolvd, its timeout, and the status, errno and h_errno it returns for every result.
---

The shim's obligations are PSPU §6.10. This chapter describes the module
resolvd's source tree builds.

## The object

- `libnss_peios_net.so.2` is installed by `dev.peios.resolvd-nss` at
  `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-peios/libnss_peios_net.so.2`. [*nss-module.installed-path]
- It is built from the `nss` crate, with the native channel codec
  compiled in. Its shared-object dependencies are `libgcc_s.so.1`,
  `libc.so.6` and the dynamic loader, `ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`; it does
  not link libpeios. [*nss-module.link-dependencies]

### The entry points [*nss-module.entry-points]

The module exports six entry points:

| Entry point | Asks |
|---|---|
| `_nss_peios_net_gethostbyname4_r` | `lookup`, family `any` |
| `_nss_peios_net_gethostbyname3_r` | `lookup`, family from `af` |
| `_nss_peios_net_gethostbyname2_r` | as `gethostbyname3_r`, with no TTL or canonical name out |
| `_nss_peios_net_gethostbyname_r` | as `gethostbyname3_r`, with `af` `AF_INET` |
| `_nss_peios_net_gethostbyaddr2_r` | `reverse` |
| `_nss_peios_net_gethostbyaddr_r` | as `gethostbyaddr2_r`, with no TTL out |

## One connection per call

- Every call that needs resolvd opens a new connection to
  `/run/resolvd/resolv.sock`, sends one request, reads one reply, and
  closes the connection. [*nss-module.one-connection-per-call]
- Nothing is kept between calls: no connection, no cache, no
  configuration. The module reads no file. [*nss-module.no-state-no-files]

### The ten-second socket timeouts [*nss-module.ten-second-socket-timeouts]

Each connection is given ten-second read and write timeouts, which
apply to each read and write on the socket. Ten seconds is longer than
the six seconds three timed-out attempts take in resolvd (§4.6), so a
slow upstream normally reaches the caller as `unavailable` from resolvd
rather than as a timeout here. A question that takes longer — several
expansions in turn, or truncated replies retried over TCP — reaches the
timeout, which is reported as the table below shows.

## Results

| Result | NSS status | `errno` | `h_errno` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Addresses, or names, found | `SUCCESS` | — | — [*nss-module.found-is-success] |
| `found`, but no address of the asked family | `NOTFOUND` | `ENOENT` | `HOST_NOT_FOUND` [*nss-module.found-without-family-is-host-not-found] |
| `notfound` | `NOTFOUND` | `ENOENT` | `HOST_NOT_FOUND` [*nss-module.notfound-is-host-not-found] |
| `unavailable` | `TRYAGAIN` | `EAGAIN` | `TRY_AGAIN` [*nss-module.unavailable-is-try-again] |
| No reply within ten seconds | `TRYAGAIN` | `EAGAIN` | `TRY_AGAIN` [*nss-module.timeout-is-try-again] |
| resolvd cannot be connected to | `UNAVAIL` | `ENOENT` | `NO_RECOVERY` [*nss-module.unreachable-is-unavail] |
| An error reply, including `access denied` | `UNAVAIL` | `ENOENT` | `NO_RECOVERY` [*nss-module.error-reply-is-unavail] |
| A reply of the wrong kind, a reply that does not decode, or any other I/O error | `UNAVAIL` | `ENOENT` | `NO_RECOVERY` [*nss-module.other-failures-are-unavail] |
| The caller's buffer is too small | `TRYAGAIN` | `ERANGE` | `NETDB_INTERNAL` (`-1`), required for retry; see version note below [*nss-module.small-buffer-is-erange] |
| `gethostbyname3_r` or `2_r` with an `af` other than `AF_INET` or `AF_INET6` | `UNAVAIL` | `EAFNOSUPPORT` | `NO_DATA` [*nss-module.unsupported-family-forward] |
| `gethostbyaddr2_r` or `_r` with an `af` and length other than `AF_INET`/4 or `AF_INET6`/16 | `UNAVAIL` | `EAFNOSUPPORT` | `NO_RECOVERY` [*nss-module.unsupported-family-reverse] |
| A null name, a name that is not UTF-8, or a null address | `NOTFOUND` | `ENOENT` | `HOST_NOT_FOUND` [*nss-module.null-or-non-utf8-input-is-notfound] |

The missing-family row above describes
[source `b4f7085`](https://github.com/peios/resolvd/blob/b4f70857729069952762f8e2a2b56357b15d4760/nss/src/lib.rs):
a found name with no address of the family asked is reported exactly as
a name that does not exist. This does not meet PSPU §6.10's requirement
that `found` without an address of that family return `NO_DATA`.

The [proposed source correction](https://github.com/peios/resolvd/blob/6d23bf920c60e3695781fc960e292a139d77b044/nss/src/lib.rs) preserves
`NOTFOUND` and `ENOENT`, but sets `h_errno` to `NO_DATA` when a `found`
reply has no usable address of the requested family. A `found` reverse
reply with no `PTR` record has the same result. Explicit `notfound`
still returns `HOST_NOT_FOUND`; `unavailable` and transport failures keep
their distinct results in the table. This describes proposed source
behavior, not a released package or an installed module. Check the
installed module's source revision before relying on this distinction.

### `AF_UNSPEC` [*nss-module.af-unspec-only-via-gethostbyname4]

`AF_UNSPEC` is accepted only by `gethostbyname4_r`, which always asks
for both families.

## The caller's buffer [*nss-module.results-placed-in-caller-buffer]

Every string, pointer array and address the module returns is placed in
the buffer glibc passes in; the module allocates nothing that outlives
the call. When the buffer cannot hold the result, the call returns as in
the table, and nothing written to the buffer is valid.
