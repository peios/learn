title: The Service
description: How peinit runs resolvd — the service definition, the identity it runs under, the port reservation that lets it bind port 53, readiness, restart, and where its log lines go.
---

## The service definition seed [*service.definition-seed-inert-until-applied]

resolvd is started by peinit from `Machine\System\Services\resolvd`. The
package ships the definition as a registry seed,
`/usr/share/regim/resolvd-service.reg`, which is inert until an image
names it in its `[registry] autoapply` list.

## The service definition values

| Value | Type | Data | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ImagePath` | `REG_SZ` | `/usr/sbin/resolvd` | The binary. resolvd reads no command-line arguments. [*service.image-path-no-arguments] |
| `Triggers` | `REG_MULTI_SZ` | `boot` | Started at boot. [*service.triggered-at-boot] |
| `Identity` | `REG_SZ` | `Service` | Runs under its own virtual service account. [*service.identity-is-own-virtual-account] |
| `Readiness` | `REG_DWORD` | `0` | Notify: ready when resolvd says so. [*service.readiness-is-notify] |
| `RuntimeDirectories` | `REG_MULTI_SZ` | `resolvd` | peinit creates `/run/resolvd`. [*service.runtime-directory] |
| `RestartPolicy` | `REG_DWORD` | `2` | Always restarted. [*service.restart-policy-always] |
| `ErrorControl` | `REG_DWORD` | `0` | |
| `DisplayName` | `REG_SZ` | `Stub resolver` | |
| `Description` | `REG_SZ` | (one sentence) | |

## Identity and privilege

resolvd holds no privilege and needs none. Its one claim on the machine
that an ordinary process could not make — binding UDP and TCP port 53 —
is met by a port reservation rather than a capability (PSPU §6.8).

Without the reservation applied, the stub listener cannot bind and
resolvd exits at startup (§2.2, §9.3).

### The port reservation seed [*service.port-reservation-seed]

The reservation is a second seed, `/usr/share/regim/resolvd-port.reg`,
also inert until an image applies it. It writes one value:

| Key | Value | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `Machine\System\Network\TcpIp\PortReservations` | `tcp,udp:53` | `REG_BINARY` |

### Who holds the reservation [*service.reservation-granted-to-system-and-service-sid]

The data is a security descriptor granting the reservation to SYSTEM and
to resolvd's service SID,
`S-1-5-80-3864064249-1823296737-2008945602-1354971773-2894779966`, so it
follows the service rather than whichever account the service happens to
run as.

The selector `tcp,udp:53` is more specific than the kernel package's
`tcp,udp:1-1023` and so decides port 53 alone. The descriptor bytes are
generated from the SID by a tool in the source tree, not written by
hand.

## Readiness

With `Readiness` 0 peinit waits for a notification. resolvd:

- sends the datagram `READY=1` to the socket named by the
  `NOTIFY_SOCKET` environment variable once the native socket and both
  stub sockets are open and the registry has been read; [*service.ready-after-doors-open]
- does not wait for netd: readiness is sent after the first attempt to
  reach netd whether that attempt succeeded or not; [*service.ready-does-not-wait-for-netd]
- sends nothing when `NOTIFY_SOCKET` is unset, and logs a failure to
  send as `readiness notify: <error>` and carries on starting. [*service.notify-failure-not-fatal]

## Restart

`RestartPolicy` 2 restarts resolvd whenever it exits. Everything resolvd
holds is in memory, so a restarted resolvd starts with:

- an empty cache; [*service.restart-empties-cache]
- no demoted servers; [*service.restart-clears-demotions]
- every counter at zero (§4.10);
- no scopes, and the kernel's hostname, until the first snapshot after
  netd is reached again (§3.3). [*service.restart-starts-without-scopes]

## Log lines

### The log line format [*service.log-line-format]

Every line resolvd logs is written to standard error as

```text
resolvd: <level>: <text>
```

where the level is `info`, `warn` or `error`. peinit forwards a
service's standard error to eventd, which is where the lines are read:

```sh
evctl 'LOGS FROM resolvd SINCE 1h ago TAKE 40'
```

### The kernel log mirror [*service.kmsg-mirror-fails-once]

Each line is also offered to `/dev/kmsg`, at kernel priority 6, 4 or 3
for info, warn and error. The mirror is opened when the first line is
logged, after that line has been written to standard error, and the open
is never retried.

`/dev/kmsg` is writable by SYSTEM only, so for resolvd the open fails,
and resolvd writes one line to standard error saying so, directly after
the first log line:

```text
resolvd: warn: /dev/kmsg mirror unavailable (<error>): log lines go to stderr only
```

The first two lines on standard error are therefore the first line
resolvd logs, and then this one. The first logged line is a warning
from earlier in startup when there is one — `removed a stale …` after
any restart, or a `Dns …` warning (§2.3) — and otherwise the result of
the first attempt to reach netd, `subscribed to netd` or
`netd not reachable (<error>); retrying`, which comes before
`listening on …` (§2.2). The mirror line is written once, and nothing
further about the mirror is written. resolvd's lines never reach the console or
`dmesg`.
