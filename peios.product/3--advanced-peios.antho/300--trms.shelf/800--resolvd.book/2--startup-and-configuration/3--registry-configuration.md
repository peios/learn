title: Registry Configuration
description: The values resolvd reads from Machine\System\Network\Dns, how each is parsed and what a malformed one does, and how a change reaches the running daemon.
---

The registry holds resolvd's fallbacks and its static names, under
`Machine\System\Network\Dns`; which keys a resolver reads is fixed by
PSPU §6.9. Nothing about the live network is read from the registry;
that arrives from netd (§3).

## The `Dns` key and its defaults [*config.absent-key-gives-defaults]

The key is opened for query and enumerate-subkey access. When it does
not exist or cannot be opened, every value below takes its default.

| Value | Type read | Default | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FallbackServers` | `REG_MULTI_SZ`, or one `REG_SZ` / `REG_EXPAND_SZ` | none | The fallback scope's servers (§4.4) |
| `ExtraSearchDomains` | `REG_MULTI_SZ`, or one `REG_SZ` / `REG_EXPAND_SZ` | none | Search domains after every interface's (§4.3) |
| `ControlSecurity` | `REG_BINARY` | the compiled default | The control object (§5.2) |
| `Hosts\` | a subkey | empty | Static names (§4.2) |

## Reading strings

- A `REG_SZ` or `REG_EXPAND_SZ` is one string: its data up to the first
  NUL, read as UTF-8. When those bytes are not UTF-8, the value is
  treated as absent, with no log line. [*config.single-string-read-to-first-nul]
- A `REG_EXPAND_SZ` is read as it is stored; nothing in it is expanded. [*config.expand-sz-not-expanded]
- A `REG_MULTI_SZ` is split at every NUL. Empty strings are skipped, and
  a string that is not UTF-8 is skipped silently, with no log line,
  while the other strings are used. [*config.multi-sz-empty-and-non-utf8-strings-skipped]
- A value of any other type is treated as absent. [*config.other-value-types-treated-as-absent]

## `FallbackServers`

- Each string is trimmed of surrounding whitespace and parsed as an IPv4
  or IPv6 address. A string that does not parse is skipped and logged as
  `Dns FallbackServers: ignoring malformed address "<string>"`, with the
  string as stored — untrimmed, in double quotes, with quotes,
  backslashes and control characters escaped. A lone `REG_SZ` that is
  empty or only whitespace, a whitespace-only string in a multi-string,
  and an address with a zone such as `fe80::1%eth0` (§4.7) are all
  logged this way. [*config.fallback-malformed-address-skipped-and-logged]
- There is no way to give a port; every server is asked on port 53. [*config.fallback-servers-port-53]

The order of the list is the order servers are tried in (§4.6).

## `ExtraSearchDomains` [*config.extra-search-domain-malformed-skipped-and-logged]

Each string is parsed as a domain name, with or without a trailing dot.
It is not trimmed, so a leading or trailing space becomes part of a
label. A string that does not parse, or that is the root — a lone empty
`REG_SZ`, or `.` — is skipped and logged as
`Dns ExtraSearchDomains: ignoring malformed domain "<string>"`, quoted
as for `FallbackServers`.

## `ControlSecurity`

- A `REG_BINARY` value with at least one byte is taken as a
  self-relative security descriptor. An empty value, a value of another
  type, or an absent value selects the compiled default, with no log
  line. [*config.control-security-empty-or-wrong-type-selects-default]
- Bytes that do not form a valid descriptor also select the compiled
  default, and resolvd logs
  `ControlSecurity is not a valid descriptor (<error>); using the default`
  each time it builds the control object from them: at startup, and at
  every configuration change (below). [*config.control-security-invalid-selects-default-and-logs]

## `Hosts\`

- Every value under `Machine\System\Network\Dns\Hosts` is one static
  name. The value's name is the host name and its data is one address
  (`REG_SZ` or `REG_EXPAND_SZ`) or several (`REG_MULTI_SZ`), read as
  above. [*config.hosts-value-is-one-static-name]
- A value name that is not UTF-8 is skipped silently. [*config.hosts-non-utf8-name-skipped]
- A value name that does not parse as a domain name is skipped and
  logged as `Dns Hosts: ignoring malformed name "<name>"`. [*config.hosts-malformed-name-skipped-and-logged]
- A value name that parses to the root — an empty name, or `.` — is
  skipped silently. [*config.hosts-root-name-skipped-silently]
- Each address is parsed as for `FallbackServers`, and a malformed one
  is skipped and logged as
  `Dns Hosts: ignoring malformed address "<string>"`. [*config.hosts-malformed-address-skipped-and-logged]
- A name left with no valid address, including one whose value has any
  other type, is not a static name at all. [*config.hosts-name-without-address-dropped]
- Names match case-insensitively, so `Printer` and `printer` are the
  same static name. [*config.hosts-names-case-insensitive]

Where the same address is listed under several names, the reverse lookup
of that address returns one of them (§4.2). A static name named
`localhost`, or under it, never answers a forward question (§4.2).

## Changes at run time

### The watch on the network key [*config.watches-network-key-recursively]

resolvd watches `Machine\System\Network`, recursively and for every kind
of change, rather than the `Dns` key itself: the `Dns` key need not
exist at boot, and a watch on a missing key cannot see it appear. Watch
events are read into a 16 384-byte buffer.

### What triggers a re-read [*config.any-event-rereads-dns-key]

Every non-empty batch of watch events, from anywhere under
`Machine\System\Network`, causes the whole `Dns` key to be read again,
as at startup. netd's own writes under that key cause such re-reads too.
Each re-read logs the `Dns FallbackServers`, `Dns ExtraSearchDomains`
and `Dns Hosts` warnings above again for every malformed string still
present, whether or not anything has changed.

### An unchanged configuration [*config.unchanged-configuration-is-a-no-op]

The fresh configuration is compared with the one in use. When nothing
differs, nothing is applied and nothing more is logged.

### A changed configuration

When anything differs, resolvd, in this order:

1. rebuilds the control object from `ControlSecurity`; [*config.change-rebuilds-control-object]
2. replaces the fallback servers and search domains, discarding every
   answer cached through the fallback scope if the server list differs
   in content or in order; [*config.fallback-server-change-flushes-fallback-cache]
3. replaces the static names; [*config.change-replaces-static-names]
4. logs `configuration changed` at info level. [*config.change-logged]

### When a change takes effect

- Every change applies to the questions and requests that arrive after
  it; nothing needs a restart. [*config.changes-apply-live]
- Static names are never cached, so a new or removed `Hosts\` value is
  visible to the next question. [*config.static-name-change-visible-at-once]
- Answers already cached through an interface scope are not discarded
  by a registry change. [*config.registry-change-keeps-interface-cache]

### When the watch fails

- If reading watch events fails, resolvd logs
  `registry watch: <error>; re-arming` and arms a new watch. The key is
  not read again when the new watch is armed, so a change made in
  between is applied only with the next event. [*config.watch-error-re-arms]
- If arming the new watch also fails, watching stops without a further
  message, and the configuration in use stays as it is until resolvd
  restarts. [*config.failed-re-arm-stops-watching-silently]
