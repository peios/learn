title: Applying a Snapshot
description: How each snapshot becomes resolvd's hostname and scope list — the conversion of each field, what is dropped, and which cached answers are discarded.
---

Each snapshot replaces resolvd's scopes whole (PSPU §6.9). Applying one
has three parts: the hostname, the scope list, and the cache.

## The hostname

- The snapshot's `hostname` is used when it is not empty. When it is
  empty, resolvd reads the kernel's hostname at that moment, into a
  256-byte buffer; a kernel hostname that is empty or `(none)` counts as
  none. [*netd-snapshot.empty-hostname-reads-kernel-hostname]
- The result is parsed as a domain name. A name that does not parse, or
  the root, leaves resolvd with no hostname: no synthetic answer is
  given for it, and `status` reports an empty `hostname`. [*netd-snapshot.unparseable-hostname-is-no-hostname]
- The kernel's hostname is otherwise read only at startup. A change to
  it is not seen until the next snapshot with an empty `hostname`. [*netd-snapshot.kernel-hostname-read-only-at-snapshot-or-startup]

## The scope list

Each `DnsScope` in the snapshot becomes one scope, in snapshot order:

| Snapshot field | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `ifid` | The scope key [*netd-snapshot.ifid-is-scope-key] |
| `name` | The interface name reported in answers and in `status` [*netd-snapshot.name-is-reported-interface] |
| `servers` | Server addresses, in order. A string that is not an IP address — an address with a zone such as `fe80::1%eth0` included — is dropped. There is no port; servers are asked on port 53. [*netd-snapshot.servers-parsed-malformed-dropped] |
| `domains` | Search domains, in order. A string that does not parse as a name, and the root, are dropped. [*netd-snapshot.domains-parsed-malformed-dropped] |
| `addresses` | `(address, prefix length)` pairs. A string that is not `address/prefix` is dropped. [*netd-snapshot.addresses-parsed-malformed-dropped] |
| `default_route`, `exclusive`, `metric`, `level` | Carried as they are |
| `ntp` | Ignored |

The `ifid` is used as it arrives. netd's interface ids are UUIDs, so
none is `fallback`, the key of the fallback scope (§4.4); a scope that
did arrive with that key would share the fallback scope's cache
entries, would be asked through the fallback servers, and would lend
its interface name to the fallback scope's answers.

### Every scope is kept [*netd-snapshot.every-scope-kept]

Dropped entries are dropped silently. Every scope in the snapshot is
kept, whatever its level or server count; which of them take part in
routing is decided per question (§4.4).

### The snapshot summary line [*netd-snapshot.summary-log-line]

resolvd then logs one line at info level summarising the snapshot:

```text
netd: eth0: 1 server(s), 1 domain(s), default; wg0: 1 server(s), 0 domain(s)
```

with `, default` on each scope that claims the default route, or
`netd: no scopes` for an empty snapshot. The counts are of the servers
and domains left after parsing.

## The cache

Comparing the new scope list with the old one, by scope key:

- a scope whose key is new loses any cached answers under that key; [*netd-snapshot.new-scope-key-flushed]
- a scope whose server list differs from before — in content or in
  order — loses its cached answers; [*netd-snapshot.changed-server-list-flushes-scope]
- a scope missing from the new snapshot loses its cached answers; [*netd-snapshot.missing-scope-flushed]
- a change to a scope's domains, addresses, flags, metric or level
  leaves its cache alone. [*netd-snapshot.other-changes-keep-cache]

Demotion is kept per server address, not per scope, and survives every
snapshot (§4.6).

## Questions already in flight

- A candidate is routed when it is first asked (§4.4), and its retries
  stay with the scope key it was routed to. When that scope's servers
  change, retries use the new list; when the scope has gone, the next
  retry finds no servers and the question ends `unavailable`. [*netd-snapshot.in-flight-retries-follow-scope-key]
- A transaction already sent is not cancelled by a snapshot, and its
  reply is cached under the scope key it was routed to. [*netd-snapshot.in-flight-reply-cached-after-flush]
