title: "kacs.caap.policy.changed"
description: "The record that a central access policy was installed, replaced or removed."
---

- **Event type:** `kacs.caap.policy.changed`
- **Defined in:** `kacs.evman`
- **Tier:** essential
- **Gating:** none — every change a caller holding SeTcbPrivilege makes is recorded
- **Cardinality:** once per kacs_set_caap call that passed the privilege gate

The record that a central access policy was installed, replaced or removed.
A policy decides access to every object whose SACL names it, alongside that
object's own DACL, so one change here can widen or narrow access across the
whole system without touching any object.

Only a caller holding SeTcbPrivilege, enabled, may change a policy; a call
refused for want of it is not recorded. A call that passed the gate is
recorded whether or not it applied: a malformed specification leaves the
old policy in force and the record says so.

The record names the policy, not its rules. Compare two records' effects by
the access records that follow them.

## Fields

| Field | Type | Presence | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`subject.token.sid`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-subject#subject.token.sid) | `bin.sid` | via [`subject`](~peios/events/groups/group-subject) | The user SID of the effective token the operation ran under. |
| [`subject.token.groups`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-subject#subject.token.groups) | `bin.sid[]` | via [`subject`](~peios/events/groups/group-subject) | The group SIDs carried by the effective token. |
| [`subject.token.group-attributes`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-subject#subject.token.group-attributes) | `uint.flags[]` | via [`subject`](~peios/events/groups/group-subject) | Per-group attribute bitmasks, positionally parallel to `subject.token.groups`. |
| [`subject.token.integrity`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-subject#subject.token.integrity) | `uint.integrity` | via [`subject`](~peios/events/groups/group-subject) | The integrity RID of the effective token. |
| [`subject.token.id`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-subject#subject.token.id) | `uint.luid` | via [`subject`](~peios/events/groups/group-subject) | The token's own LUID, identifying this specific token rather than the logon session it belongs to. |
| [`subject.token.auth-id`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-subject#subject.token.auth-id) | `uint.luid` | via [`subject`](~peios/events/groups/group-subject) | The LUID of the logon session the effective token belongs to. |
| [`subject.token.type`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-subject#subject.token.type) | `str.enum` | via [`subject`](~peios/events/groups/group-subject) | Whether the effective token is a primary token or an impersonation token. |
| [`subject.token.impersonation`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-subject#subject.token.impersonation) | `uint.enum` | via [`subject`](~peios/events/groups/group-subject) | The impersonation level of the effective token. |
| [`subject.token.uid`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-subject#subject.token.uid) | `uint` | via [`subject`](~peios/events/groups/group-subject) | The Linux UID this token projects onto, for correlating a Peios event with Linux-side audit data. |
| [`emitter.process.pid`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-emitter#emitter.process.pid) | `uint` | via [`subject`](~peios/events/groups/group-subject) | The process ID the record was written from. |
| [`emitter.process.name`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-emitter#emitter.process.name) | `str` | via [`subject`](~peios/events/groups/group-subject) | The kernel's name for the emitting process, typically the executable's basename. |
| [`emitter.process.executable`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-emitter#emitter.process.executable) | `str.path` | via [`subject`](~peios/events/groups/group-subject) | The path the emitting process was executed from, resolved at exec with symbolic links already followed. |
| [`subject.pip.type`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-subject#subject.pip.type) | `uint.enum` | via [`subject`](~peios/events/groups/group-subject) | The Protected Isolated Process type in force for the access check. |
| [`subject.pip.trust`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-subject#subject.pip.trust) | `uint` | via [`subject`](~peios/events/groups/group-subject) | The PIP trust level in force for the access check. |
| [`caap.policy.sid`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-caap#caap.policy.sid) | `bin.sid` | required | The SID identifying a central access policy. |
| [`operation.name`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-operation#operation.name) | `str.enum` | required | `set` installs a policy, or replaces the one of the same SID whole; `remove` takes it away, after which objects naming it are decided by the recovery policy.<br><br>Values here (closed set): `set` · `remove`. |
| [`outcome.success`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-outcome#outcome.success) | `bool` | required | Whether the operation succeeded. |
| [`outcome.errno`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-outcome#outcome.errno) | `int.errno` | when `outcome.success == false` | The error the operation failed with, as a negative errno. |

Every record also carries the header fields of [the envelope](~peios/events/introduction/the-envelope), which no payload repeats.
