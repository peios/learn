Collect the current state and cause before changing anything:

```
$ svctl status <service>
$ svctl list
$ svctl boot
```

Keep the job or operation ID and any warnings. Open **Logs…** for the service in Services Manager to inspect its main process, hooks, and health checks. For older attempts, query [logs and events](~peios/services-and-jobs/output-and-logging); live status is not a permanent history.

Use the symptom below to choose the next check. Avoid repeating a restart or changing permissions until you know which layer failed.

## A service won't start

`status` shows it `Failed` or `Skipped`. The **cause** says why:

| Cause | What happened | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `ValidationError` | The definition is malformed — a bad field, an unresolvable conflict, an illegal health-check timing. | Check the logs for the specific field. Fix the definition; the message names what is wrong. |
| `DependencyFailure` | A `Requires`/`BindsTo` target failed or does not exist. | Fix the *target* first — `status` it. The dependent recovers once the target can start. |
| `ConditionSkipped` (→ Skipped) | A start-time [condition](~peios/services-and-jobs/execution-environment) was not met. **Not a failure** — the service decided it does not apply here. | If it *should* run, the condition's premise is false (a missing path/file/key). This is often correct behaviour. |
| `TtyUnavailable` (→ Skipped) | Another service is holding the terminal this one names in `TTYPath`. **Not a failure** — it is waiting its turn. | Check who has it: the holder is the other service with that `TTYPath` in a running state. Give this one a higher `TTYPrecedence` to win next boot, or a [`tty:released`](~peios/services-and-jobs/triggers-and-timers) trigger so it starts when the terminal frees. |
| `AssertionError` | A start-time [assert](~peios/services-and-jobs/execution-environment) failed — a required precondition is missing. | Create the missing precondition (path, file, directory, registry key), then start again. |
| `PreHookFailure` | An `ExecStartPre` hook exited non-zero. | Inspect the hook’s captured output and its [identity](~peios/services-and-jobs/identity-and-privileges). Before rerunning it manually, check for side effects: setup and migration hooks may change data. |
| `ParentSetupFailure` | peinit could not even fork — fd/PID exhaustion, a cgroup error. No process was created. | A system-resource problem, not the service's fault. Check for fd/PID limits and cgroup health. |
| `PreExecFailure` | Setup after fork failed — token install, rlimits, environment. | Usually identity: check `Identity`, that authd is up, and that `RequiredPrivileges` names real privileges. |
| `ReadinessTimeout` | The process started but never became [ready](~peios/services-and-jobs/service-types) within `StartTimeout`. | Either the service is genuinely slow (raise `StartTimeout`, or have it send `EXTEND_TIMEOUT_USEC`) or it never sends `READY=1` (wrong `Readiness`, or a bug). |

> [!TIP]
> A startup failure (`ReadinessTimeout`, `PreHookFailure`, `PreExecFailure`, `ParentSetupFailure`) is **restart-eligible**. Whether it was retried depends on the configured policy and budget; `Failed` alone does not prove multiple attempts occurred. Read the [restart policy](~peios/services-and-jobs/supervision) and the logs for the actual attempts.

## A service keeps restarting

The service flaps — up, down, up, down. This is [restart policy](~peios/services-and-jobs/supervision) doing its job, but it points at an unstable service.

- **It eventually settles in `Failed` with `RestartBudgetExhausted`.** It crashed `RestartMaxRetries` times faster than it could stay healthy for `RestartWindow`. The fix is the *service*, not the policy — read its logs for the crash. Raising the budget only delays the inevitable.
- **It flaps forever and never exhausts the budget.** Check whether it stays Active for the full `RestartWindow` between failures. Reaching Active briefly does not reset the budget. Inspect the [health-check](~peios/services-and-jobs/supervision) output too; a faulty check can restart a working service.
- **It restarts on a clean exit you did not expect.** `RestartPolicy=Always` restarts even successful exits (cause `CleanExitRestart`). If the service is *meant* to exit, use `OnFailure` instead.

## The machine keeps rebooting

Preserve the last console error and any service records before attributing repeated reboots to a service. **If peinit reports a Critical service exhausting its restart budget**, its [`ErrorControl=Critical`](~peios/services-and-jobs/supervision) policy makes peinit sync and reboot. Repeating that failure can produce a reboot loop; the symptom alone does not establish this cause.

The [boot-attempt counter](~peios/services-and-jobs/boot-and-boot-modes) can break a sequence of boots that reach peinit's counter increment but never become confirmed: after N attempts (default 3), peinit enters [Recovery mode](#booted-into-recovery-mode). If each boot reaches the success grace before the Critical failure, its counter is reset and the reboot loop can continue without automatic Recovery. Check `svctl boot` while the normal control interface is available; it is unavailable in Recovery. Do not assume every reboot loop will stop after three attempts, or that peinit can deliver Recovery if it cannot start.

In Recovery, start with the failure reason on the console. Phase 2 services are skipped, so stored eventd history is not automatically queryable from that shell. Where a supported running eventd query service is available, use [Find service logs](~peios/services-and-jobs/output-and-logging) and [Find missing records](~peios/logs-and-events/find-missing-records) to investigate earlier attempts. `evctl` queries that service; it does not open stored databases offline. Otherwise, retain the console evidence for the administrator or provider's recovery procedure.

Once the evidence identifies a Critical service failure, repair its cause or restore known-good configuration through a supported recovery path before rebooting. Disabling a required platform service can leave its dependents unable to start. If you need to intervene before the counter trips, boot with `peios.recovery=1` on the kernel command line.

## A service is Abandoned

`Abandoned` means peinit SIGKILLed the process but it survived — stuck in uninterruptible kernel sleep (**D-state**), the signature of hung I/O (a dead NFS mount, a failing disk). Nothing in userspace can kill a D-state process.

- The underlying **I/O fault is the real problem** — investigate the storage or mount, not peinit.
- The service's cgroup is **leaked** and shows in `warnings`. A later start uses a fresh [generational cgroup](~peios/services-and-jobs/execution-environment), so the new instance is unaffected.
- `svctl reset <service>` clears the Abandoned state and re-checks the cgroup: if the stuck process finally died, peinit cleans up; if not, it stays leaked and warns you. Leaked cgroups clear fully only on reboot.

## I changed the config and nothing happened

peinit works from an [in-memory snapshot](~peios/services-and-jobs/defining-a-service), and each field has a **mutability class** that decides when a change applies:

- **Immutable at runtime** (`ImagePath`, `Type`, `Identity`, `RequiredPrivileges`, `ErrorControl`) → takes effect only on `restart`.
- **Apply on next start** (dependencies, conditions, `OnFailure`) → next start or graph reload.
- **Reloadable at runtime** → next relevant operation. Timeouts and health-check policy can affect later checks; environment, arguments, working directory and process limits apply to a new process, not one already running.
- **Hot-reloaded** (`ServiceSecurity`) → next control request.

If a change is not landing, check its class first. For a wholesale re-read of every definition, run `svctl reload-config` — it rebuilds and validates the whole graph atomically and swaps it in only if validation passes (running services are untouched). And remember peinit *pulls* changes from [registry notifications](~peios/registry-concepts/watches) rather than having them pushed, so there can be a brief lag.

## ACCESS_DENIED

A control command returns `ACCESS_DENIED`. peinit ran [AccessCheck](~peios/access-decisions/overview) on your token against the target's descriptor and the right was not granted:

- A *service* command needs the matching right in the service's [ServiceSecurity descriptor](~peios/services-and-jobs/who-can-manage-a-service) (`start` needs `SERVICE_START`, `restart` needs both stop and start, …).
- `shutdown` and `reload-config` need `SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN` / `SYSTEM_RELOAD_CONFIG` in peinit's control descriptor.
- The check uses your **effective** identity at connect time — if you are [impersonating](~peios/impersonation/overview), that is what is checked.

Under the default descriptors every denial is recorded by the kernel as a `kacs.audit.access.checked` event naming the caller, the target (its **object kind** is `service`, `job` or `peinit-system`) and the rights requested and granted. Walk it through [Debugging a denial](~peios/access-decisions/debugging-a-denial).

> [!NOTE]
> If `list` shows fewer services than you expect, that is not a bug — `list` **omits** services you lack `SERVICE_QUERY_STATUS` on rather than denying them. You are seeing exactly what your token can see. `job list` does the same with `JOB_QUERY`.

## A job submission is refused

A `job submit` — from `svctl` or from a service — comes back with an error rather than a job. The code says which door it hit:

| Code | What happened | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| connection refused, or an immediate close | You cannot reach `/run/services/peinit/jobs.sock` — its file descriptor does not grant you write, or peinit is at `MaxJobsConnections`. peinit itself performs no check on who may submit; the socket's descriptor is the whole policy. | Check the socket's descriptor (by default Authenticated Users may connect) and the connection count. |
| `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` | Your SID already holds `MaxJobsPerSubmitter` live jobs (default 64). | `job list --submitter <your SID>` to find them; stop what should not be running, or raise the key. SYSTEM is exempt. |
| `BAD_TOKEN` | The token you attached cannot become a job identity: more than one was attached, it is below Impersonation level, or peinit could not duplicate it. | Attach exactly one token obtained by impersonating the client; an Identification-level token is never enough. If the job needs Delegation, set the jobs connection to Delegation *before* attaching. |
| `INVALID_ARGUMENTS` | The definition is malformed — a relative `image_path`, a `descriptors` list that does not match what you attached, a `security_descriptor` without an owner and DACL. | The message names the field. |
| `INVALID_STATE` | The system is shutting down; submissions are refused. | — |

A job that was *accepted* but never ran is not an error response: it is an `ok` response whose view is `failed` with a `cause` — `parent_setup_failure` (peinit could not prepare the launch) or `pre_exec_failure` (the program could not be executed as that identity, which is where "no such file" and "permission denied" land, because peinit does not check the image before accepting a submission).

## A job's output has gaps

If a submitter attached an output sink and sees gaps, look for a `peinit.job.output.dropped` event for the job in [eventd](~peios/auditing/overview): the sink was not being drained fast enough, and peinit dropped lines *for the sink only* rather than let it slow the job. Query eventd under the job’s GUID for the independently forwarded record. Sink loss does not itself drop that record, but eventd’s log path is also best-effort, so completeness is not guaranteed.

## UNKNOWN_JOB

The GUID is unknown or its retention has elapsed. A submitted job is retained for 60 seconds after it ends, then dropped; check eventd for any stored record. A known job that you lack permission to query returns `ACCESS_DENIED`. `job list` instead omits jobs you cannot query.

## A dependent never started

You started (or booted) a service, but something that depends on it never came up:

- A **`Requires`/`BindsTo` dependent stays blocked** until its target reaches a [satisfying state](~peios/services-and-jobs/the-service-lifecycle) (Active, Reloading, Completed, or Skipped). If the target is stuck in Starting or Failed, so is the dependent — fix the target.
- If a dependent got *connection refused* on boot, check the target's readiness setting and startup logs. With **`Readiness=Alive`**, peinit waited only for the process to exist, not to be serving. Use `Readiness=Notify` only if the program supports sending `READY=1` from its tracked main process when ready; changing the setting does not add that support and can cause `ReadinessTimeout`. See the [notification contract](~peios/services-and-jobs/service-types#the-sd-notify-contract). If the program cannot signal readiness, have its service or package owner resolve the startup race. peinit's boot validation warning can identify an Alive-readiness dependency; it does not prove the cause of a refused connection.
- A **`Wants` dependent waits for the optional target’s startup attempt to resolve**, but starts even if the target failed. Use `Requires` when successful readiness is necessary.

## Booted into Safe mode

[Safe mode](~peios/services-and-jobs/boot-and-boot-modes) selects Critical and `SafeMode=1` services within the boot-triggered set. Those flags do not give a demand-only service a boot trigger. You land here when graph validation finds a **cycle or unresolvable conflict involving a Critical service**, or when `peios.safemode=1` is on the kernel command line. The TCB is healthy; the *configuration* is broken.

Fix the graph: the logs name the cycle path (`A → B → C → A`) or the conflicting pair. Once the cycle is broken or the conflict resolved, a normal boot returns. You can start any service by hand from Safe mode in the meantime — it is only auto-start that is restricted.

## Booted into Recovery mode

[Recovery mode](~peios/services-and-jobs/boot-and-boot-modes) gives you a SYSTEM shell on the console and skips Phase 2 services. It starts registryd only if the boot has not already attempted that start. You reach it when the boot counter hits N, when `peios.recovery=1` is set, or when **registryd failed in Phase 1** (Recovery is immediate; this boot attempt has already incremented the counter).

If the registry itself is failing:

1. Preserve peinit's console failure reason and the source's startup diagnostics. A failed registry operation does not prove the source process has exited.
2. Identify the installed `registryd` provider and version, its hive declarations and actual database paths. [LCS and sources](~peios/registry-administration/lcs-and-sources) explains the default `loregd` provider and its diagnostics.
3. Establish whether the source is already active before any storage work. Recovery may retain a registryd started or attempted earlier in the boot. **Do not launch a second source against the same hive files.**
4. Obtain the installed provider's supported recovery procedure before attempting offline inspection or repair. The [loregd command-line reference](~peios/loregd/startup/command-line) documents hive declarations, not offline repair switches; its [startup sequence](~peios/loregd/startup/startup-sequence) does not establish an automatic backup on every start. Verify what recovery copy actually exists and what it contains before planning a replacement.

When the source is serving the required registry operations, [Backup and restore](~peios/registry-administration/backup-and-restore) describes the supported privileged subtree workflow. That workflow depends on a working source; it does not repair an unavailable source. Restore replaces the target contents and descendants, including security descriptors, so review the target and backup before using it. Role definitions can re-supply service configuration but do not restore every registry value.

Recovery offers **no TCB guarantee**. Treat the unrestricted SYSTEM shell accordingly, and remember it needs console access (physical, IPMI, or serial); there is no remote recovery yet.

## Where to start

To read states and causes fluently, keep [The service lifecycle](~peios/services-and-jobs/the-service-lifecycle) handy.
