In **Services Manager**, select the service and choose **Logs…**. It opens [Event Viewer](~peios/logs-and-events/event-viewer) with the service’s lines and the output of its hooks and health checks, newest first and updating as they arrive.

For terminal queries, use [evctl](~peios/evctl/using-evctl). peinit forwards output; **eventd** stores and queries the records it receives.

## Find the failed run

1. Run `svctl status <service>` and note its state, cause, current job ID, and warnings.
2. Open **Logs…** and inspect the time around the failure. Hook and health-check output can explain a start or health failure even when the main process wrote nothing.
3. Match the **job GUID** to isolate one execution. A restart has a new job ID.
4. For earlier attempts, look for `peinit.job.started`, `peinit.job.ended`, and the operation events in eventd. The live job or operation may already have expired.

Log origins identify the producer: the service name, a hook such as `jellyfin/ExecStartPre[0]`, or `jobs/<id>` for a submitted job. A log’s stream tells you stdout or stderr, not whether the line necessarily describes an error.

## Capturing output

peinit captures stdout and stderr, including hooks and health checks, and tags lines with the origin, stream, timestamp, and job GUID. A submitted job cannot opt out of forwarding; `--output` requests an additional live copy.

> [!WARNING]
> A service with `TTYPath` sends all three standard streams to its terminal. Its output is **not captured** for eventd. Check the terminal or change the service’s output arrangement if you need a log record.

Pipe wiring and tagging are described in the [output-flow reference](~peios/advanced-peios/peinit/output-handling/service-output-flow#capturing-output).

## Logs and events have different limits

Service logs and structured events take separate paths:

| Record | Path | What to expect |
|---|---|---|
| Service stdout/stderr | peinit’s output buffer and eventd’s log socket | Best-effort; lines can be truncated or dropped under load. |
| Job, operation, access-check, and failure events | KMES, then eventd | Independent of the log socket. KMES holds a finite in-memory record; eventd supplies stored history. |

Do not assume an event has survived a reboot merely because it was emitted. The kernel ring is not persistent, and it can overwrite older events if consumers fall behind. See [KMES failure modes](~peios/advanced-peios/peios-kernel/kmes/failure-modes) for those limits and [Auditing](~peios/auditing/overview) for event storage and queries.

## The pre-eventd buffer

Before eventd is available, peinit holds output in memory, by default up to `PreEventdBuffer=1048576` bytes. Overflow drops the oldest lines. The buffer is replayed when eventd is ready, but it is not persistent storage and cannot guarantee a complete boot log.

The [buffer reference](~peios/advanced-peios/peinit/output-handling/service-output-flow#the-pre-eventd-buffer) explains the early-boot path.

## Flood protection

A `[truncated]` marker means a line exceeded `MaxLogLineLength` (8192 bytes by default). Output delivered faster than peinit can read can block the service’s writes at its pipe; downstream delivery to eventd is loss-tolerant.

If a submitted job’s live output has gaps, look for `peinit.job.output.dropped`. That reports loss in the extra output copy, not necessarily loss in eventd; query eventd separately. Ordinary log delivery remains best-effort there too.

See the [registry limits](~peios/services-and-jobs/registry-key-reference#operational-parameters) before changing buffer sizes and the [TRM flood-control detail](~peios/advanced-peios/peinit/output-handling/service-output-flow#flood-protection) for the implementation.

## The eventd handoff

When eventd reaches Active, peinit replays buffered output and forwards new lines. If eventd exits, peinit resumes buffering and repeats the handoff when it returns. Missing log lines around that interval can reflect buffer overflow or lossy delivery; an empty query alone does not prove the service wrote nothing.

Access policy can also hide records from a query. Check [who may read what](~peios/logs-and-events/overview#who-may-read-what) if the expected origin is absent. The [handoff reference](~peios/advanced-peios/peinit/output-handling/service-output-flow#the-eventd-handoff) describes transport behaviour.

## Console output

peinit writes boot progress, shutdown progress, recovery entry, and critical failures to `/dev/console`. Service output is not echoed there by default. A terminal-attached service is the exception because it writes directly to its terminal.

`peios.quiet` can suppress peinit’s console messages, and suppressed messages are dropped rather than saved for later. See [console noise settings](~peios/services-and-jobs/boot-and-boot-modes#console-noise-peios-quiet) when investigating a boot problem.

## Where to start

For symptom-based next steps, use [Troubleshooting](~peios/services-and-jobs/troubleshooting). For finding older executions or actions, use [Jobs and operations](~peios/services-and-jobs/jobs-and-operations). For query tools, use [Event Viewer](~peios/logs-and-events/event-viewer) or [evctl](~peios/evctl/using-evctl).
