- **Event type:** `peinit.service.reload.timed-out`
- **Defined in:** `peinit.evman`
- **Tier:** standard
- **Gating:** none — every reload left unconfirmed past its deadline is recorded
- **Cardinality:** one record per occurrence

A service announced `RELOADING=1` and never confirmed the reload by its
deadline: it wedged mid-reload, or lost its handler. Recorded because the
default `reload` does not wait, so nothing else would say so.

Formerly `service.reload_unconfirmed`.

## Fields

| Field | Type | Presence | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`object.service.name`](~peios/events/field-index/fields-object#object.service.name) | `str` | required | The name of the service the event is about, as its definition names it. |

Every record also carries the header fields of [the envelope](~peios/events/introduction/the-envelope), which no payload repeats.
