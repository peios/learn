A trail site is a directory tree in which every name means something. This page walks that tree from the root down, and explains the naming grammar all of it shares. [Directory and file names](~trail/reference/directory-names) is the same material as an exhaustive table; [Structuring a site](~trail/structuring-a-site/products) covers each kind of container in depth.

## The whole shape

│   │       └── a1--glossary.md          Appendix A
│   └── 2--tooling.shelf/                a shelf — a heading, not a URL segment
│       └── 1--pekit.topic/              →  /peios/pekit   (the shelf adds nothing)
│
└── pekit.product/                       another product  →  /pekit
```

Everything below the root is optional. A site with one product, one topic and one article is a complete site; this site's `trail.product` is exactly that shape, four levels shallower than `peios.product`.

## The naming grammar

Three name shapes appear throughout the tree.

| Shape | Example | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `<slug>.product` | `pekit.product` | Only at the site root. |
| `<order>--<slug>.<kind>` | `2--writing.topic` | Anthologies, topics, books, shelves. |
| `<order>--<slug>` | `300--tokens`, `2--model` | Topic subfolders and book chapters — no suffix. |
| `<order>--<slug>.md` | `100--sids.md` | Articles. |
| `<order>--<slug>.link` | `3--faq.link` | Aliases; see [Link aliases](~trail/structuring-a-site/link-aliases). |

The parts:

- **`<order>`** is a non-negative integer used only for sorting among siblings. It never appears in a URL or a title. Gaps are fine and normal — numbering articles `100`, `200`, `300` leaves room to insert. Two siblings sharing an order is an error, because the resulting page order would depend on nothing you can see.
- **`<slug>`** is lowercase kebab-case: ASCII lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, not starting or ending with a hyphen. It becomes the URL segment, and it is what you write in a `~link`.
- **`<kind>`** is `antho`, `topic`, `book` or `shelf`.

Inside books, an order may also be written `a<N>--` (`a1--glossary.md`). Those are **appendices**: lettered `A`, `B`, `C` instead of numbered, and sorted after every numbered sibling at their level. See [Books](~trail/structuring-a-site/books).

## URLs

A page's URL is its product slug followed by the slug of every container between the product and the page — with two exceptions.

```text
peios.product/1--security-fundamentals.antho/1--identity.topic/100--sids.md
  →  /peios/security-fundamentals/identity/sids
```

The exceptions:

- **A shelf contributes no segment.** It is a heading on its parent's page, nothing more. A topic inside `2--tooling.shelf/` lives at `/peios/<topic>`, exactly as if the shelf were not there.
- **Order prefixes contribute nothing.** `1--identity.topic` gives the segment `identity`.

Which containers have a page of their own is worth knowing, because it decides what you can link to:

| | Has a page | Links to it land on |
|---|---|---|
| Site | `/` | — |
| Product | `/pekit` | its own landing page |
| Anthology | `/peios/security-fundamentals` | its own landing page |
| Book | `/peios/…/pgss` (the cover) | the cover |
| Article | its own URL | itself |
| Topic | no page | *(topics are not link targets)* |
| Topic subfolder | no page | *(not a link target, except from a `.link`)* |
| Book chapter | no page | *(not a link target)* |
| Shelf | no page | *(not a link target)* |

Topics, subfolders and chapters are real structure — they appear in sidebars, cards and contents lists, and links from those surfaces open their first article — but they have no page you can address, so a `~link` cannot point at one. Point at the article you actually mean.

## Titles

Titles come from three places, in order of precedence:

1. **An article's `title:` frontmatter**, which is required.
2. **A container's `trail.toml`**, where the `title` key is required for products, anthologies and books, and optional for topics, subfolders, chapters and shelves.
3. **The slug**, hyphens to spaces and each word capitalised: `the-two-gates` becomes "The Two Gates".

The derived form is good enough surprisingly often; write a `trail.toml` when it is not — acronyms and casing it cannot guess ("Peiso", "The Console"), or when the container needs `inline_ref` phrases.

## What may sit where

Trail rejects anything it does not recognise, so it is worth knowing what each level tolerates.

| Directory | May contain |
|---|---|
| The site root | `trail.toml`, `*.product/`, the output directory, files named by the config |
| A product | `trail.toml`, `.antho/`, `.topic/`, `.book/`, `.shelf/` |
| An anthology | `trail.toml`, `.antho/`, `.topic/`, `.book/`, `.shelf/` |
| A shelf | `trail.toml`, the same as its parent minus shelves — a shelf never holds a shelf |
| A topic | `trail.toml`, `.md` articles, `<order>--<slug>/` subfolders, `.link` files, images |
| A topic subfolder | `trail.toml`, `.md` articles, `.link` files, images |
| A book | `trail.toml`, `.md` articles, `<order>--<slug>/` chapters, `.link` files, images |
| A book chapter | `trail.toml`, `.md` articles, `<order>--<slug>/` chapters, `.link` files, images |

Only the article-holding levels take files: `.md` articles, `.link` aliases and images may sit in a topic, a subfolder, a book or a chapter, and nowhere else. A product, anthology or shelf directory holds `trail.toml` and subdirectories, full stop.

Images sit beside the articles that use them and are published at the URL of the directory they were found in; see [Images](~trail/writing/images).

Two slugs are reserved: `print` (every container publishes a `/print` page) may not be an article slug, and `assets` and `pagefind` may not be product slugs.

## Ordering

Siblings sort by their `<order>` prefix, ascending. Within a book, appendix entries (`a<N>--`) sort after every numbered entry at the same level, and they are lettered rather than numbered.

Products are the exception: they have no order prefix. They sort by the root config's `featured` list first, in that list's order, then everything else by title.

## Where to go next

- [Products](~trail/structuring-a-site/products) — the product level in depth, and when to add another one.
- [Anthologies and shelves](~trail/structuring-a-site/anthologies-and-shelves) — grouping a large product.
- [Topics and folders](~trail/structuring-a-site/topics-and-folders) — the everyday container.
- [Books](~trail/structuring-a-site/books) — numbered, ordered documents with chapters and appendices.
