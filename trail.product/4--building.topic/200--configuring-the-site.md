One `trail.toml` at the site root configures the whole site. It is the only place these settings live — there is no per-environment config, no CLI equivalent for most of them, and unknown keys are build errors rather than typos you find out about later.

```toml
sitename = "Peios Learn"
title = "Documentation for everything Peios"
url = "https://learn.peios.org"
accent = "#3b82f6"
description = "Concepts, guides, and reference for the Peios operating system and every project around it — from the kernel to the toolchain that builds it."

featured = ["peios", "pekit", "provium", "universal-directory", "trail"]

footer = "Peios Learn — documentation for the Peios project."
```

[The `trail.toml` reference](~trail/reference/trail-toml) is the exhaustive table; this page is what each setting is *for*.

## The four required keys

`sitename`, `title`, `description` and `footer` must all be present.

**`sitename`** is the site's identity: the wordmark in the header, the suffix on every page's `<title>`, the search box's placeholder, and `og:site_name`. Its **last word is accented** in the wordmark — "Peios *Learn*" — so a two-word name reads best. A one-word name simply gets no accent.

**`title`** and **`description`** are the front page's headline and standfirst, and its meta description and social-preview text. The description is also the first line of `llms.txt`, so write it as a summary of the whole site rather than a slogan.

**`footer`** is the line at the foot of every page. Beneath it, "Built with Trail." appears unless `built_by_trail = false` turns it off.

## The base URL

```toml
url = "https://learn.peios.org"
```

Optional, and worth setting before you deploy. Without it:

- **no `sitemap.xml` is written**, because sitemaps require absolute URLs, and `robots.txt` gets no `Sitemap:` line;
- **canonical URLs stay root-relative** rather than absolute;
- **`og:url` is omitted**, since a relative one is meaningless to the crawlers reading it;
- **`/print` bundles link outward relatively**, which is right on the site and wrong on paper.

Trailing slashes are trimmed, so `https://learn.peios.org/` and `https://learn.peios.org` behave identically.

> [!NOTE]
> Trail builds for the **root of a domain**. Internal links are root-relative (`/pekit/reference/cli`), so serving the site from a subpath is not supported.

## Featured products

```toml
featured = ["peios", "pekit", "provium", "universal-directory", "trail"]
```

The list does two jobs: it orders products, and it decides which appear on the front page.

- Products in the list sort first, in the list's order; everything else follows, by title.
- **Only listed products get a card on the front page.** An unlisted product is still built, still searchable, still linkable, and still in the header's products menu.
- Naming a product that does not exist is a build error.

## Header navigation

```toml
[[nav]]
label = "Specs"
url = "~peios/pgss"

[[nav]]
label = "Source"
url = "https://github.com/peios/peios"
```

Each `[[nav]]` block adds a link to the header, beside the products menu. On narrow screens they move inside that menu.

Keep the `[[nav]]` blocks at the **end of the file**: in TOML every key after a table header belongs to that table, so an ordinary key written below them becomes a nav field and fails the build.

`url` may be an external URL, a root-relative path, or a [`~` page reference](~trail/writing/links-and-references). References are resolved **strictly, at load time** — even with `--allow-dangling-links`, a broken nav link fails the build. Site chrome appears on every page; it must never dangle.

## Favicon

```toml
favicon = "favicon.png"
```

A path relative to the site root. The file is copied to the output root under its own name and linked from every page. The file must exist, or the build fails.

Naming a file here is also what makes it *legal* to keep in the site root, which otherwise accepts only `trail.toml` and `*.product` directories.

## Edit links

```toml
edit_url = "https://github.com/peios/peios/edit/main/learn2/{path}"
```

Adds an "Edit this page" link to the foot of every article. `{path}` is replaced with the article's source file path relative to the site root — the placeholder is required, and a template without it is a build error.

For an [alias page](~trail/structuring-a-site/link-aliases) the link points at the *original's* source file, since that is the file to edit.

## Injecting your own head HTML

```toml
head_html = "head.html"
```

A path to a file whose contents are injected verbatim at the end of every page's `<head>`: analytics snippets, extra meta tags, a webfont, a verification token.

It is inserted unescaped and unchecked, at the end of the head, so it can override earlier tags. It is the escape hatch for everything trail does not have a setting for — and, like all escape hatches, the thing to reach for last.

## Files trail does not build

```toml
passthrough = ["CNAME", ".well-known"]
```

Some files have to be in the published site without trail having any opinion about them: a `CNAME` for a custom domain, a `.well-known/` directory, a search-engine verification file. `passthrough` names them, and each one is copied into the output exactly as it is — directories whole.

This matters most when the site root **is** a repository root. Trail accepts only `trail.toml` and `*.product` directories there, so a `CNAME` sitting beside them would otherwise fail the build. Naming it here makes it legal *and* publishes it.

Two details worth knowing:

- Entries are copied **after** everything trail generates, so naming `robots.txt` replaces the generated one — useful, and a foot-gun if you name `assets`.
- Dot-entries like `.github/` are already skipped by the root scan, so they only need naming here if you want them **published**. `.well-known/` does; `.github/` does not.

> [!TIP]
> A repository whose root is a trail site cannot hold a `README.md` — it is an unexpected root file. Put it at `.github/README.md`, which GitHub renders on the repository page and trail skips.

## Theming

Four keys control colour:

```toml
accent = "#3b82f6"
accent_dark = "#7aa8ff"     # optional; derived from accent if absent
custom_css = "custom.css"   # optional
product_theming = true      # default
```

`accent` is the site's colour. `accent_dark` overrides its dark-mode variant, which is otherwise derived by mixing the accent toward white. `custom_css` names a stylesheet shipped at `/assets/custom.css` and loaded after the built-in one. `product_theming = false` stops each product tinting its own pages.

Both colours must be `#rrggbb`, and setting `accent_dark` without `accent` is an error. [Theming](~trail/building/theming) covers what these actually reach.

## What may live in the site root

The site root accepts `trail.toml`, `*.product` directories, the build output directory, dot-entries (`.git` and friends), and **whatever `favicon`, `custom_css`, `head_html` and `passthrough` name**. A setting naming `assets/site.css` makes the whole `assets/` directory legal at the root — it is the first path component that is tolerated. Anything else is a build error.

That last clause is the reason those three settings take paths rather than inline content: naming a file is what makes it part of the site.
