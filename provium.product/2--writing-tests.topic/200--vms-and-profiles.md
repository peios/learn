Every Provium test ultimately drives one or more guest VMs. This page covers the lifecycle: creating a VM, picking its profile, controlling boot, taking snapshots, and tearing down.

The exhaustive reference is on [VM](~provium/reference/vm).

## Creating a VM

```lua
local vm = provium:vm("name", "profile")
```

The first arg is the VM's name (per-scope unique). The second arg is a profile name from `provium.toml`. The VM is in `Created` state until you call `:boot()`.

**Two forms.** `provium:vm(name, profile)` *creates* a VM in the current scope. `provium:vm(name)` *looks one up* by name, walking from the current scope to the file root. Inside a `test()` body, the current scope is the per-test scope; at file top-level, it's the file root. See [labs and scope](~provium/writing-tests/labs-and-scope) for the full rules.

Optional third arg is a sizing table — the two keys the scheduler and QEMU need before boot:

```lua
local vm = provium:vm("v", "peios", {memory = "2G", cpus = 4})
```

Everything else about a boot — kernel command line, determinism seeds, injected files — is passed to `vm:boot(opts)` instead:

```lua
vm:boot({
    kernel_cmdline = "console=ttyS0 quiet earlyprintk=ttyS0",
    rng_seed = 0xdeadbeef,
    initial_time = 1700000000,
    files = {
        {path = "/etc/hostname", content = "v"},
        {path = "/root/.ssh/authorized_keys", content = pubkey},
    },
})
```

The split is deliberate: `memory` and `cpus` size the VM, and the scheduler needs them when the VM is declared; the boot opts shape one particular boot and merge per field into the VM's pending boot options.

## Booting

```lua
local vm = provium:vm("v", "peios"):boot()
```

`:boot()` returns `self` so you can chain. The VM is in `Booted` state on return. A `vm_spawned` event fires as soon as the agent has handshaken; consumers see it before `:boot()` returns.

For multi-VM tests, you can boot each individually:

```lua
local a = provium:vm("a", "peios"):boot()
local b = provium:vm("b", "peios"):boot()
```

Or batch-boot via the lab:

```lua
provium:vm("a", "peios")
provium:vm("b", "peios")
provium:boot()                -- boots both
```

The batch form is mainly useful when you've declared a topology in a fixture builder and want to bring it up atomically.

## Profiles

A profile is a `[profiles.<name>]` block in `provium.toml`:

```toml
[profiles.peios]
kernel   = "/build/peios/bzImage"
initrd   = "/build/peios/initrd.cpio.gz"
cmdline  = "console=ttyS0 quiet"
guest_os = "peios"
```

Each profile names a (kernel, initrd, cmdline) tuple. A test picks which profile to use by name:

```lua
provium:vm("a", "peios")           -- uses [profiles.peios]
provium:vm("a", "peios-debug")     -- uses [profiles.peios-debug]
```

You can have any number of profiles. Common patterns:

| Pattern | Profiles |
|---|---|
| Test against multiple kernel versions | `peios-stable`, `peios-mainline` |
| Compare optimised and debug builds | `peios`, `peios-debug` |
| Test pre/post a feature flag | `peios-prefeatx`, `peios-postfeatx` |

Multi-profile fixtures invalidate every cached fixture when any profile's kernel or initrd identifier changes — see [fixtures and dependencies](~provium/running-tests/fixtures-and-dependencies).

## Lifecycle methods

A VM's lifecycle: `:boot()` takes it from `Created` to `Booted`; `:pause()` / `:resume()` toggle between `Booted` and `Paused`; `:reset()` warm-reboots (still `Booted`); and `:shutdown()` or `:power_button()` end in `Shutdown`. The full state machine and per-method semantics are in the [VM reference](~provium/reference/vm#state-machine).

Operations against a VM in the wrong state error cleanly with a hint: `VM not booted` on a `Created` VM, `VM is paused; use resume()` on a `Paused` one, `VM is shutdown; create a new one` after shutdown.

You typically don't call `:shutdown()` explicitly. The harness's resource-graph walker tears every VM down at the appropriate scope boundary: test-scope VMs at the end of their `test()` body, file-scope VMs at file end. (`reset_between_tests = true` snapshots and restores instead — see [labs and scope](~provium/writing-tests/labs-and-scope).)

## Boot opts in detail

The opts you'll use most often are `memory` and `cpus` (sizing, at creation), `kernel_cmdline` (per-VM `loglevel`, `nokaslr`, etc. — replaces the profile's `cmdline`; at boot), and `files` (inject config before init runs; at boot):

```lua
local vm = provium:vm("v", "peios", {memory = "1G", cpus = 2})
vm:boot({
    files = {
        {path = "/etc/test.conf", content = "key=value\n"},
    },
})
```

This is a subset — the full boot-opts table (types, defaults, `rng_seed`, `initial_time`) is in the [VM reference](~provium/reference/vm#boot-opts).

## Querying VM state

The accessors you'll use most are `vm:state()` (returns `"created"`, `"booted"`, `"paused"`, `"shutdown"`, or `"dead"`) and `vm:is_quiescent()` (true when there are no in-flight ops, open files, or open streams). The full accessor list — `name`, `profile`, `cid`, `open_file_count`, `open_stream_count` — is in the [VM reference](~provium/reference/vm#accessors).

`is_quiescent` and the open-count accessors are useful for snapshot precondition asserts:

```lua
test("snapshot is taken at quiescence", function(t)
    local vm = provium:vm("v", "peios"):boot()
    vm:run("…")
    t:assert(vm:is_quiescent(), "VM must be quiescent before snapshot")
    local s = vm:snapshot()
    t:assert(s:size() > 0)
end)
```

## Snapshots

```lua
local s = vm:snapshot()              -- writes to a tempfile
local s = vm:snapshot("/tmp/x.snap") -- writes to that path
```

Returns a [Snapshot](~provium/reference/snapshot) userdata wrapping the path. Use it to:

- Restore later in the same test: `vm:shutdown(); vm:restore(s)`.
- Inspect size: `s:size()`.
- Delete: `s:delete()` (idempotent).

The snapshot file is what fixture builders return. If the snapshot fails because of an open stream, the error names the stream's creation site — close streams before snapshotting:

```lua
test("snapshot needs no open streams", function(t)
    local vm = provium:vm("v", "peios"):boot()
    local stream = vm:tail_file("/var/log/messages")
    -- vm:snapshot() would error here; close first.
    stream:close()
    local s = vm:snapshot()
end)
```

## Restoring

Restore from a Snapshot userdata or a bare path string:

```lua
vm:shutdown()
vm:restore(s)            -- from snapshot userdata
vm:restore("/tmp/x.snap") -- from path
```

The VM moves through `Shutdown → Created → Booted` (the restored state is already `Booted`). Restoring requires the VM to be in `Created` or `Shutdown` first.

## Determinism patterns

For tests that depend on randomness or wall-clock time, fix both at boot:

```lua
local vm = provium:vm("v", "peios")
vm:boot({
    rng_seed = 0xdeadbeef,
    initial_time = 1700000000,
})
```

After boot, you can move time forward (or backward) with `vm:clock():advance(N)` — see [Clock reference](~provium/reference/clock).

## Pausing for inspection

`vm:pause()` freezes the guest's vCPUs. Useful for:

- Time-sensitive tests where you need to read multiple bits of state without races.
- Snapshotting (the snapshot path will pause anyway, but explicit pause makes the test's intent clear).

```lua
vm:pause()
local before = vm:read_file("/proc/loadavg")
vm:resume()
```

## Reset and power-button

`vm:reset()` warm-reboots the guest — same VM, same RAM image initially, then init re-runs. Stays in `Booted`.

`vm:power_button()` sends ACPI power-button. The guest's init handles it as a graceful shutdown signal (typically: stop services, sync filesystems, kernel halts). Ends in `Shutdown`.

```lua
test("guest survives reset", function(t)
    local vm = provium:vm("v", "peios"):boot()
    vm:write_file("/tmp/before", "1")
    vm:reset()
    -- /tmp is tmpfs in the test profile; vm:reset() is a warm
    -- reboot, so /tmp is fresh. Check that the test's expectation
    -- matches what the profile actually does.
    local r = vm:run("test ! -f /tmp/before")
    r:assert_ok()
end)
```

## Multi-VM topologies

The two-VM pattern is the workhorse of networking tests:

```lua
local lan = provium:bridge("lan")
local a   = provium:vm("a", "peios"):boot()
local b   = provium:vm("b", "peios"):boot()
lan:attach({a, b})
a:run("ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev eth0 && ip link set eth0 up")
b:run("ip addr add 10.0.0.2/24 dev eth0 && ip link set eth0 up")

test("a can reach b", function(t)
    a:run("ping -c 1 -W 1 10.0.0.2"):assert_ok()
end)
```

For larger topologies, use sub-labs to keep names organised — see [labs and scope](~provium/writing-tests/labs-and-scope).
