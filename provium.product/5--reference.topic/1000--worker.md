A Worker is what `vm:spawn_worker()` returns: a sub-agent connection to the same VM. It exposes the same VM-style API for running commands, opening files, and issuing syscalls — handles allocated under it live in the worker's own namespace on the agent side.

A worker is a real, separate guest process: a re-exec'd copy of the agent that the main agent relays ops to over a socket pair. Its syscalls run with its own credentials — its own kernel token, privileges and process security block — so a test can stand up two distinct security principals in one VM: a caller and the target of a process check, an unprivileged caller against a privileged operation, two peers on a socket. Handles a worker allocates live in its own table; the main agent routes them, so from the test's side they look like any other handle.

## Constructing

| Source | Returns |
|---|---|
| `vm:spawn_worker()` | New worker on the VM's main agent. |
| `vm:spawn_worker({thread = false})` | Same. (`{thread = true}` is rejected with a future-work pointer.) |

## Methods

The worker mirrors the VM's run / file / syscall surface. Where semantics differ from the VM equivalent, it's noted explicitly.

### `worker:run(cmd, opts?)`

Synchronous exec. Same call shape as [`vm:run`](~provium/reference/vm#vm-run-cmd-or-args-opts). Returns a [RunResult](~provium/reference/vm#runresult).

### `worker:run_async(cmd, opts?)`

Async spawn. Returns a [Process](~provium/reference/process). Like `vm:run_async`, the `timeout` opt is rejected — pass it to `proc:wait` instead.

The child is forked and exec'd *by the worker*, so it starts life with the worker's credentials: whatever token the worker installed, whatever privileges it adjusted, is what the new program runs under. That is what makes exec-time behaviour testable from a principal the test minted — a token surviving or being relabelled at exec, a descriptor without `FD_CLOEXEC` crossing into the new image, a child's identity after its parent impersonated. `proc:pid()` gives the child's pid for the main agent to inspect from outside.

`proc:wait`, `proc:kill`, `proc:pid`, `proc:status` and the stdin methods all work; the main agent relays them to the worker, and the worker performs them — so they run with the worker's credentials *at that moment*. A worker that is impersonating another user, or has installed a lowered token, may find `proc:kill` on its own child refused with EPERM; revert or restore before reaping. `proc:stdout_stream()` and `proc:stderr_stream()` do not work — a stream owns its connection for its lifetime and the worker channel is a request/reply pipe — so read a worker-spawned child's output from the `RunResult` that `proc:wait` returns.

The returned Process is auto-registered with the test's resource registry, so the scope walker SIGTERMs and reaps it at scope end. Without this, a worker-spawned child would leak past the test boundary. Joining the worker first orphans any child still running: it is reparented to PID 1 and the Process handle no longer reaches it.

### `worker:open_file(path, mode_table)` — rejected

There is no worker-scoped File. The call errors with `worker_open_file: not supported for a process-isolated worker`, and the reason is structural: a worker is a separate guest process with its own file table, so a descriptor opened there would be out of reach of `file:read`, `file:write` and `file:close`, which act through the parent agent.

Open files from inside the worker with [`worker:syscall`](#worker-syscall-nr) instead, so the descriptor is created, used and closed in the worker's own process under the worker's credentials:

```lua
-- x86-64 syscall numbers: openat = 257, write = 1, close = 3.
local AT_FDCWD, O_WRONLY_CREAT_TRUNC = -100, 0x241
local r = w:syscall(257, {
    args = { AT_FDCWD, 0, O_WRONLY_CREAT_TRUNC, tonumber("644", 8) },
    bufs = { "/tmp/from-worker\0" },   -- NUL-terminated path
    ptrs = { 1 },                       -- buf 1 → arg slot 1
})
local fd = r.ret
w:syscall(1, { args = { fd, 0, 2 }, bufs = { "hi" }, ptrs = { 1 } })
w:syscall(3, fd)
```

If the file only needs to be read or written by the *test*, and the worker's identity does not matter, `vm:open_file` on the VM is the simpler call.

### `worker:syscall(nr, …)`

Direct syscall. Same call shape as [`vm:syscall`](~provium/reference/vm#vm-syscall-nr) — both the integer-only and table forms work. Returns the same `{ret, result, errno, out_bufs}` shape.

### `worker:kill(sig?)`

Broadcast a signal to every async process spawned under this worker. Argument shape mirrors `proc:kill`: nil → SIGTERM, int → that signal, string → friendly name.

A bad argument type (e.g. a Lua table) errors with the type-name in the message rather than silently defaulting to SIGTERM. This catches test-code typos.

### `worker:join()`

Wait for every in-flight worker child to exit. Returns whatever the agent reports as the joined exit summary.

### `worker:handle()`

Returns the worker's opaque handle id.

### `worker:close()`

Auto-close hook. SIGTERMs every in-flight worker child, then joins. The scope walker fires this at scope end.

## Concurrency pattern

Workers shine for tests that need two threads of control inside the same guest:

```lua
test("two concurrent writers don't tear", function(t)
    local vm = provium:vm("v", "peios"):boot()
    local w1 = vm:spawn_worker()
    local w2 = vm:spawn_worker()

    -- Each worker writes its own block of data, in parallel.
    local p1 = w1:run_async("dd", {args = {"if=/dev/urandom", "of=/tmp/a", "bs=1M", "count=8"}})
    local p2 = w2:run_async("dd", {args = {"if=/dev/urandom", "of=/tmp/b", "bs=1M", "count=8"}})

    p1:wait("10s"):assert_ok()
    p2:wait("10s"):assert_ok()

    t:assert_eq(vm:stat("/tmp/a").size, 8 * 1024 * 1024)
    t:assert_eq(vm:stat("/tmp/b").size, 8 * 1024 * 1024)
end)
```

For coordination between workers' guest processes, use a guest-side primitive (file, fifo, etc.). [`lab:barrier(name, count, timeout?)`](~provium/reference/lab#lab-barrier-name-count-timeout) is a host-side rendezvous — a worker's guest processes can't call it. See [Labs and scope — Barriers](~provium/writing-tests/labs-and-scope#barriers) for what barriers can and can't synchronise today.
