`mount` attaches a filesystem to the Peios mount tree. With no operands it instead *lists* what is currently mounted. It is a faithful reworking of the util-linux `mount(8)` surface for Peios, with two structural differences: Peios has **no `/etc/fstab` and no `/etc/mtab`**, so every mount is described entirely on the command line and live mount state is read from the kernel; and a `mount` can apply a **KACS mount policy** to the new filesystem at attach time (see [Mount policies](~peios/mount-policies/overview)).

```
mount [-t TYPE] [-o OPTIONS] SOURCE TARGET
mount [-o remount,OPTIONS] TARGET
mount --bind|--rbind|--move SOURCE TARGET
mount --make-shared|--make-private|... TARGET
mount [-l] [-t TYPE]
```

Internally `mount` uses the fd-based mount API (`fsopen` / `fsconfig` / `fsmount` / `move_mount`, plus `open_tree` and `mount_setattr`), never the classic single-shot `mount(2)`. This matters in one place you can see: when a mount fails, the kernel's `fs_context` message log is drained and printed as the reason, even without `-v`.

## Operands and argument shapes

Because there is no fstab to consult, operand resolution is strict:

- **No operands, no verb** — list mode (see [below](#list-mode)).
- **Two operands** — `SOURCE TARGET`.
- **One operand** — an error. In util-linux a lone operand is resolved through fstab; Peios has none, so a single operand cannot be turned into a `SOURCE TARGET` pair. Supply both, or use `--source` / `--target`.
- **A lone target** is valid only for `-o remount` and for a standalone propagation change (`--make-*`), which act on an existing mount point.

`--source SRC` and `--target DIR` name the operands explicitly and may be combined with a single positional. `--target-prefix DIR` prepends `DIR/` to the target after it is chosen. Options may be interspersed with operands (`mount SRC -o ro TGT`), matching util-linux.

Paths, `-o key=value` values, labels and UUIDs are handled as **opaque byte strings**, never assumed to be UTF-8; an embedded NUL is a usage error.

### Canonicalisation

By default source and target paths are canonicalised (made absolute, symlinks resolved). `-c` / `--no-canonicalize` disables that; `X-mount.nocanonicalize[=source|target]` is the `-o` form and can disable it for just one side. The final path handed to the kernel is protected against a TOCTOU symlink swap on its last component.

## Operation modes (verbs)

`mount` performs one of several operations. The **structural verbs** — bind, rbind, move, beneath and remount — are mutually exclusive with one another. A **propagation** change is *not* a structural verb: it may stand alone on a target, or trail another verb or a new mount in the same command (applied afterwards as one or more `mount_setattr` steps), and several may be combined.

| Verb | How to request it | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **New mount** | `mount [-t T] SRC TGT` | Attach a fresh instance of the filesystem at `SRC` onto `TGT`. |
| **Bind** | `-B` / `--bind`, or `-o bind` | Make an existing subtree visible at a second location. |
| **Recursive bind** | `-R` / `--rbind`, or `-o rbind` | Bind a subtree together with every mount underneath it. |
| **Move** | `-M` / `--move`, or `-o move` | Relocate an existing mount to a new mount point. |
| **Move beneath** | `--beneath SRC TGT` | Attach `SRC` *beneath* the mount currently at `TGT` (the kernel enforces several constraints; violations surface as exit 32). |
| **Remount** | `-o remount[,...] TGT` | Change the options of an existing mount (see [Remounting](#remounting)). |
| **Propagation** | `--make-*` / `--make-r*`, or the `-o` tokens below | Change how mount/unmount events propagate across a subtree. |
| **List** | `mount` / `mount -l` | Print the current mounts. |

### Propagation flags

Each of these sets the propagation type of the mount at the target. The `--make-r*` (and `r`-prefixed `-o`) forms apply recursively to the whole subtree; the recursive form is all-or-nothing (it either applies to the entire subtree or to none of it).

| Flag | `-o` token | Recursive flag | Recursive `-o` token | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--make-shared` | `shared` | `--make-rshared` | `rshared` | Events propagate to and from peer mounts. |
| `--make-slave` | `slave` | `--make-rslave` | `rslave` | Events propagate *in* from the master but not back out. |
| `--make-private` | `private` | `--make-rprivate` | `rprivate` | No propagation either way. |
| `--make-unbindable` | `unbindable` | `--make-runbindable` | `runbindable` | Private, and cannot be bind-mounted. |

A freshly created mount, bind or move is **private** by default unless its destination's parent is shared, in which case it joins that peer group — the standard kernel rule.

## Source specification

| Form | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Device path (`/dev/sda1`) | Used directly. |
| `-L LABEL` / `LABEL=`, `-U UUID` / `UUID=`, `PARTLABEL=`, `PARTUUID=` | Resolved to a device via libblkid. No match is a mount failure (exit 32). |
| A directory or regular file | Used directly (a bind source or target; a file may be a bind target). |
| A pseudo source (`tmpfs`, `proc`, `sysfs`, `none`, …) | Passed through; `-t` is required because it cannot be probed. |
| An image file | Attached through a loop device (see [Loop devices](#loop-devices)). |

## Filesystem type

`-t TYPE` names the type explicitly. `-t auto`, or omitting `-t` entirely, asks libblkid to **safely probe** the source; an ambiguous or multiply-signed device is refused (exit 32) rather than guessed at. `X-mount.auto-fstypes=LIST` constrains the probe candidates. Type *lists* and `no<type>` negation are not accepted in the mounting path (they remain meaningful only as a [listing filter](#list-mode)).

## The `-o` option language

`-o` takes a comma-separated list of `key` or `key=value` tokens and is repeatable (all occurrences are joined). A `key="..."` double-quoted value protects embedded commas; the `key=value` split is on the **first** `=`. Every token is sorted into one of the following categories.

### Per-mount attributes

Applied to the mount itself. Each accepts its negation; `ro`/`rw` additionally accept a `=vfs` / `=fs` / `=recursive` scope qualifier (bare is `=vfs`, non-recursive; `=fs` targets the superblock read-only flag; `=recursive` applies to the whole subtree).

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ro` / `rw` | Read-only / read-write. |
| `suid` / `nosuid` | Honour / ignore set-user-ID bits. |
| `dev` / `nodev` | Allow / disallow device nodes. |
| `exec` / `noexec` | Allow / disallow execution. |
| `atime` / `noatime` | Update / never update access times. |
| `relatime` / `norelatime` | Relative-atime updates on or off. |
| `strictatime` / `nostrictatime` | Strict-atime updates on or off. |
| `diratime` / `nodiratime` | Directory access-time updates on or off. |
| `nosymfollow` | Do not follow symlinks on this mount. There is no positive `symfollow` token — the attribute is cleared only via a remount mask. |

The atime tokens share a single mode field; the last one specified wins.

### Superblock flags

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `sync` / `async` | Synchronous / asynchronous writes. |
| `dirsync` | Synchronous directory updates. |
| `lazytime` / `nolazytime` | Lazy on-disk timestamp updates on or off. |
| `iversion` / `noiversion` | Inode version counting on or off. |
| `silent` / `loud` | Suppress or emit certain kernel messages. |
| `mand` / `nomand` | Obsolete (removed from the kernel). Accepted and ignored with a note under `-v`. |

### Filesystem-specific parameters

Any token not recognised above is forwarded verbatim to the filesystem: `key=value` as a string parameter, a bare `key` as a flag. There is no built-in allow-list and no length limit; a rejection by the filesystem is reported with the offending key and the kernel's message.

### Userspace-only tokens

These never reach the filesystem. They include the meta-verbs `remount`, `bind`, `rbind`, `move`; the loop controls `loop` / `loop=/dev/loopN`, `offset=`, `sizelimit=` (numeric values accept `K`/`M`/`G`/`T` and `KiB`/`MiB`/… suffixes); the propagation tokens listed [above](#propagation-flags); and `defaults`, which expands to `rw,suid,dev,exec,async` (later tokens override it).

### Functional `X-mount.*` options

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `X-mount.mkdir[=mode]` | Create the target directory if missing (default mode `0755`; the alias of `-m`). |
| `X-mount.subdir=DIR` | Attach subdirectory `DIR` of a freshly mounted filesystem at the target. Effective only for a new-instance mount; silently ignored (noted under `-v`) for bind/move/remount/propagation. |
| `X-mount.noloop` | Suppress the implicit loop device for a regular-file source. |
| `X-mount.auto-fstypes=LIST` | Constrain the `-t auto` probe to these types. |
| `X-mount.nocanonicalize[=source\|target]` | The `-o` form of `-c`; with `=source` or `=target` it disables canonicalisation for just that path. |

`X-mount.idmap` and `X-mount.owner` / `group` / `mode` are **not supported** and are rejected with a usage error: Peios ownership is SID/security-descriptor based, so the fix is to add a SID/ACE to the descriptor rather than remap or chown.

### KACS mount policy

This is the genuinely Peios-specific part of `mount`. A mount policy is a per-superblock setting that governs how FACS treats the filesystem; the full model is described in [Mount policies](~peios/mount-policies/overview) and its detail pages. `mount` can set that policy at attach time:

| Option | Policy class |
|---|---|
| `-o policy=deny-missing` | `facs_deny_missing` — a file with no SD is unreachable. |
| `-o policy=synth-ephemeral` | `facs_synthesize_ephemeral` — a missing SD is synthesised in memory only. |
| `-o policy=synth-persist` | `facs_synthesize_persistent` — a missing SD is synthesised and written back. |
| `--synth-sddl SDDL` | Provide the mount-level SD template used during synthesis (only valid with a `synth-*` policy). |

`policy=unmanaged` is **not** user-settable; only the kernel sets the unmanaged class, for its own pseudo-filesystems. `policy=` is valid only on a **new mount** of a real filesystem — combining it with bind/move/remount/propagation, or with list mode, is a usage error. See [Policy classes](~peios/mount-policies/policy-classes) for what each class does and [SD storage by filesystem](~peios/mount-policies/sd-storage-by-filesystem) for how the SD is physically stored.

The policy is applied to the *detached* filesystem before it is attached: if setting it fails, nothing is ever published with an unintended policy (no rollback needed). Because setting a mount policy is a `SeTcbPrivilege`-gated operation (see [Managing mounts](~peios/mount-policies/managing-mounts)), a caller without that privilege gets a clean `EPERM` (exit 1) and no mount. `--synth-sddl` is validated client-side first — it must be well-formed SDDL and must include an owner.

Peios applies **no coarse `uid==0` check** anywhere: the `mount` applet is not installed set-user-ID, and every privileged action is authorised per-operation by KACS.

### Remounting

`-o remount` changes the options of an existing mount without detaching it. Peios does **not** perform the util-linux "read the old flags and re-supply them" dance — the fd-based API applies deltas rather than resetting, so each remount touches only what you name. Per-mount attributes (`ro`/`rw`, `nosuid`, atime, …) are changed via `mount_setattr`; superblock flags, filesystem parameters and `ro=fs`/`rw=fs` go through the superblock reconfigure path. `=recursive` remounts the whole subtree, all-or-nothing.

A **bind** mount shares its source's superblock, so any superblock-level option on a bind remount (a Category-B flag, a filesystem parameter, or `ro=fs`/`rw=fs`) is refused as a usage error rather than silently mutating the shared superblock for every mount of that filesystem. Only per-mount VFS attributes are valid on a bind remount.

## Loop devices

A regular-file source is backed by a loop device automatically **when the type is unspecified or the filesystem is recognised by libblkid**; `X-mount.noloop` suppresses this. `-o loop` forces auto-allocation of a free device, `loop=/dev/loopN` names one, and `offset=` / `sizelimit=` select a region of the file (they imply loop and are an error against a real block device). A backing file already attached at the same offset and size is *reused* rather than doubly attached, to avoid corruption. Loops created by `mount` are auto-cleared by the kernel on unmount, so they do not leak; `umount -d` force-clears the rest (see [`umount`](~peios/mount-policies/umount)).

## Other flags

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-t`, `--types TYPE` | Filesystem type, or `auto`. |
| `-o`, `--options LIST` | Mount options (above); repeatable. |
| `-r`, `--ro`, `--read-only` | Mount read-only (`-o ro`). |
| `-w`, `--rw`, `--read-write` | Mount read-write and **forbid** the automatic read-only fallback on a write-protected device (`-o rw`). |
| `--source SRC` / `--target DIR` | Name the operands explicitly. |
| `--target-prefix DIR` | Prepend `DIR/` to the target. |
| `-B`, `--bind` / `-R`, `--rbind` / `-M`, `--move` / `--beneath` | The structural verbs. |
| `--make-*`, `--make-r*` | Propagation changes. |
| `--exclusive` | Force a unique superblock instance (no reuse). Meaningful only for multi-instance filesystems (e.g. `tmpfs`) or read-only block mounts; on an already-mounted writable block device it fails with `EBUSY` (exit 32). |
| `-m`, `--mkdir[=MODE]` | Create the target directory if missing (default mode `0755`). |
| `-L`, `--label LABEL` / `-U`, `--uuid UUID` | Select the source by filesystem label / UUID. |
| `-c`, `--no-canonicalize` | Do not canonicalise paths. |
| `-f`, `--fake` | Dry run: parse, resolve and plan everything but skip the mount syscalls and the policy step. |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Narrate resolved values and each syscall; drain the kernel `fs_context` log. Repeatable but `-vv` is the same as `-v`. |
| `-l`, `--show-labels` | In list mode, append each filesystem's label. |
| `--onlyonce` | Skip the mount if it is already present (a driver-aware check against live mount state, not a naive string match). |
| `-N`, `--namespace NS` | Operate inside mount namespace `NS` (a PID, an ns file path, or a named namespace). Source resolution happens in the caller's namespace; the mount lands in the target namespace. |
| `-i`, `--internal-only` | Do not invoke a `mount.<type>` helper. |
| `-n`, `--no-mtab` | Accepted and ignored (Peios has no mtab). |
| `--synth-sddl SDDL` | KACS synth-policy template SD (above). |
| `-h`, `--help` / `-V`, `--version` | Standard. |

No external mount helpers ship in this version, so a network or FUSE type fails with "no helper for type" (exit 1) — a clean deferral, not a crash.

## List mode

With no operands, `mount` prints one line per mount, read from `/proc/self/mountinfo`:

```
SOURCE on TARGET type FSTYPE (OPTIONS)
```

`mount -t TYPE` with no operands *filters* the list by filesystem type instead of mounting; here type lists (`-t ext4,xfs`) and `no<type>` negation (`-t nosysfs`) are honoured. `-l` appends ` [LABEL]` to each line when a label is known.

Details of the rendering: the option field is the positional VFS-then-superblock merge with a coalesced `ro`/`rw`, not sorted; mountinfo octal escapes are decoded; control characters in the mount point become `?`; and the source is shown as the kernel recorded it, with `/dev/loopN` resolved to its backing file and `/dev/dm-N` to `/dev/mapper/<name>`. The listing shows only mounts the caller's token may observe; a partial or empty view is correct, not an error, and the paths of filtered-out parents are never reconstructed.

For a device-oriented view of what is available to mount, use [`lsblk`](~peios/mount-policies/lsblk).

## Exit status

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success. |
| `1` | Incorrect invocation or a permission denial — bad flags, mutually-exclusive verbs, a lone operand, an invalid `policy=` or `--synth-sddl`, an authorisation failure (`EPERM`/`EACCES`), an embedded NUL, or "no helper for type". |
| `2` | System error (out of memory, no free loop device, cannot fork). |
| `4` | Internal error (an invariant failure). |
| `8` | Interrupted (SIGINT), after signal-safe cleanup. |
| `32` | Mount failure — a syscall in the flow failed, a label/UUID had no match, a probe was undetermined, or a `--beneath`/move/`--exclusive` kernel refusal. |
| `126` | An external `mount.<type>` helper was found but failed to execute (moot until a helper ships). |

Code `16` (mtab) is never produced. Code `64` (some succeeded, some failed) only arises when several source arguments are given and at least one succeeds while another fails.
