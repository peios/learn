`nohup` runs a command so that it **survives the terminal closing**. Normally, when a terminal session ends, the system sends a hangup signal to the commands running under it, and they stop. A command started with `nohup` ignores that signal and keeps running.

```
nohup command [arg]...
```

```
$ nohup long-build &
```

It is how you start something that needs to outlast your session — a long build, a background job — without it being killed the moment you disconnect.

## Where the output goes

A command run with `nohup` is meant to outlive the terminal, so `nohup` cannot leave its streams attached to one. It redirects any stream that is still connected to a terminal:

- **Standard input**, if it is a terminal, is replaced with an empty source — the command reads nothing.
- **Standard output**, if it is a terminal, is appended to a file named `nohup.out` in the current directory. If that file cannot be opened there, `nohup` falls back to `nohup.out` in your home directory.
- **Standard error**, if it is a terminal, is sent to wherever standard output now goes.

Streams that you have already redirected yourself — to a file, or a pipe — are left as they are.

## How nohup.out is secured

When `nohup` has to **create** `nohup.out`, that file is a new file and needs a [security descriptor](~peios/security-descriptors/overview). `nohup` does not let it inherit one from the directory. It creates `nohup.out` with a deliberate, locked descriptor: **full access for the owner, and no one else**.

The reasoning is that `nohup.out` captures whatever the command writes, which the person running it has not chosen to share. A file that appears as a side effect should not be more open than its creator intended — so `nohup` gives it the safe default of owner-only, rather than whatever the surrounding directory would have handed down.

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--sddl=SDDL` | Create `nohup.out` with the security descriptor given as an SDDL string, instead of the owner-only default. |

`--sddl` only matters when `nohup` actually creates the file. If `nohup.out` already exists, `nohup` appends to it and leaves its existing security alone.

## Exit status

`nohup` exits with the command's own status once it finishes. If `nohup` cannot set things up — it cannot detach from the terminal, or cannot open `nohup.out` anywhere — it exits `125` without running the command.
