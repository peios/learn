description: Provium has three stream userdata types — Tail, Capture, and ConsoleStream — that share next/read_until/expect/drain/close/eof. They're returned by tail_file, fd_stream, file:tail_stream, bridge:capture, nic:capture, console:read, and proc stdout/stderr_stream.
---

Provium has three concrete stream types. They expose a shared surface, so test code can `:next` / `:read_until` / `:expect` / `:drain` / `:close` / `:eof` / `:creation_site` against any of them without caring which kind it is.

| Type | Returned by | Backing |
|---|---|---|
| **Tail** | `vm:tail_file`, `vm:fd_stream`, `file:tail_stream`, `proc:stdout_stream`, `proc:stderr_stream` | Frame-based agent stream over vsock. |
| **Capture** | `bridge:capture`, `nic:capture` | `tcpdump` child stdout — pcap bytes, not framed. |
| **ConsoleStream** | `console:read` (returned by `vm:console():read()`) | Unix socket connected to QEMU's console chardev. |

All three buffer "leftover bytes" past the last `expect`/`read_until` match. A subsequent `:next` returns those leftover bytes as the next frame, so test code never silently loses data.

## Common methods

### `:next(timeout?)`

Returns the next chunk of bytes as a Lua string, or `nil` at EOF / timeout. The exact frame shape:

- **Tail**: one frame per agent-side write. Each frame is whatever bytes the guest had emitted since the previous frame.
- **Capture**: chunks of pcap bytes from tcpdump's pipe (variable size, up to 64 KiB).
- **ConsoleStream**: chunks of console bytes (variable size, up to 64 KiB).

The `timeout` argument accepts seconds (number) or a string with `ms`/`s`/`m`/`h` suffix. Default: 10 seconds.

### `:read_until(pattern, timeout?)`

Pull frames until `pattern` (a Lua string) is found in the accumulated buffer. Returns the prefix up to and including the matched bytes. Errors with a pattern-naming message on timeout (`read_until timed out waiting for \`X\``) or stream EOF (`stream EOF`).

Bytes past the matched suffix are kept as `pending` and replayed on the next call.

Default timeout: 10 seconds.

### `:expect(pattern, timeout?)`

Like `:read_until` but discards the matched prefix. Returns nothing. Useful as an assertion: "the stream produced this; I don't care about the bytes". Same error shape as `read_until`.

Default timeout: 10 seconds.

### `:drain(timeout?)`

Collect every frame currently available and return them as a Lua array. Stops when the next read would block past the timeout, when EOF is reached, or when no more data is available.

Frame-per-element semantics — each iteration of the inner read produces one Lua-string entry. Pending bytes from a prior `expect`/`read_until` come out as the first entry.

Default timeout: 0.5 seconds (much shorter than `next`/`read_until`/`expect` because drain's intent is "what's available right now, then return").

### `:close()`

Close the underlying transport. Subsequent `:next` returns `nil`; subsequent `:read_until`/`:expect` error with `stream closed` / `console closed` / `capture closed`. Idempotent.

Pending bytes are dropped on close so a `:next` after close can't drain stale data.

### `:eof()`

Returns `true` once the stream's transport has reported EOF AND no `pending` bytes remain. Pending bytes mean there's still data to deliver before EOF is honest, so `eof()` returns `false` until they've been consumed.

### `:creation_site()`

Returns `{file=string, line=int}` for the test-author frame that opened the stream, or `nil` if no `*.test.lua`/`*.fixture.lua` frame is on the stack at creation. Useful for snapshot diagnostics — when `vm:snapshot()` refuses because of a live stream, the error names the offending stream's creation site so you can fix it.

## Tail-only behaviour

`vm:tail_file(path, opts?)` accepts a `start` opt:

| Value | Effect |
|---|---|
| `"end"` (default) | Stream only bytes appended after the call. |
| `"beginning"` or `"start"` | Replay the whole file from byte 0, then continue tailing. |
| Integer | Start streaming from that exact byte offset. |

A Tail closed after EOF returns `nil` from `:next` — the closed stream is semantically EOF. Earlier versions raised `tail closed`; the nil-return behaviour matches Capture and ConsoleStream so `while s:next() do … end` loops terminate cleanly.

Tails carry per-frame metadata visible to scope-end diagnostics: `kind` (e.g. `tail_file`, `fd_stream`, `file_tail_stream`, `proc_stdout_stream`), `detail` (the path or fd), `creation_site`, and `test_name`.

## Capture-only notes

Capture spawns `tcpdump -i <iface> -U -w - -s 65535`. The output is pcap-formatted bytes — the standard pcap file format with global header followed by per-packet records. Feed it through `pcap-parser`, `tshark -r -`, or `pyshark` to interpret.

The Capture holds a guard against the bridge's `active_captures` counter so a `vm:snapshot()` while capture is live errors instead of silently producing a half-captured pcap.

Drop on close prevents `:next` from returning stale tcpdump bytes after the child has been killed.

## ConsoleStream-only notes

ConsoleStream connects via `UnixStream` to the VMM's console chardev path (`vm:console_socket_path()`). Reads come back as raw bytes from the chardev — typically the boot console + login prompt + anything the guest has written to `/dev/hvc0` since the last read.

The connect-time read timeout is 50 ms. The `:next(timeout)` arg overrides it for the duration of the call and the previous timeout is restored afterwards, so a `next("5s")` followed by a bare `next()` doesn't inherit the 5s deadline forever.

Mid-stream `ConnectionReset` and `BrokenPipe` errors are mapped to "console EOF" — they happen when the QEMU chardev closes mid-read on a VM reset or shutdown. Semantically EOF for a console stream, not a real I/O error.

## Example patterns

### Wait for a log line

```lua
local f = vm:open_file("/var/log/messages", {read=true})
local stream = f:tail_stream()
stream:expect("ready", "30s")
```

### Race a process against a timeout

```lua
local proc = vm:run_async("slow-server")
local out  = proc:stdout_stream()
out:expect("listening", "10s")
-- now hit it
```

### Drain a capture and pass through pcap-parser

```lua
local cap = bridge:capture()
vm:run("ping -c 5 peer.lan")
local frames = cap:drain("2s")
local pcap = table.concat(frames)
-- write pcap to a file or feed it to a parser
```
