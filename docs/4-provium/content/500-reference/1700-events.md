description: Provium emits a stream of structured msgpack events covering file lifecycle, test outcomes, VM spawns, pool state, claims, and fixture builds. This page documents every event variant and field.
---

Provium's host-side scheduler and runners emit observability events that drive the human-readable summary, the `--json` output, `provium-coverage`, and any other consumer that wants to follow what the harness is doing.

The transport is **length-prefixed msgpack frames** (the same framing as the wire protocol). Get them via `--save-events <path>`, `--events-stdout`, or `--events-socket <path>`.

## Frame shape

Each frame is an `EventFrame`:

```
{
  "ts":      <i64>,    // ns since Unix epoch, host clock at emission
  "kind":    "<name>", // discriminator (snake_case)
  "payload": { … }     // variant-specific
}
```

The `Event` enum is flattened into the envelope so `kind` and `payload` appear at the top level of each frame.

`PROTOCOL_VERSION` (currently `1`) is bumped on any wire-shape change. Adding a new variant or field is a strict version bump; removing or renaming one is breaking. See [protocol version](~provium/reference/protocol-version) for the pinning policy.

## File lifecycle

### `file_discovered`

Emitted once per `*.test.lua` file before any dispatching begins.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | Test-root-relative path. |
| `fixture_refs` | array of strings | Fixtures referenced by `vm_fixture(...)` / `lab_fixture(...)` (path with `.fixture.lua` stripped). |
| `declared_claim` | optional `ResourceAmount` | `provium:claim(...)` declared at file scope, if any. |

### `file_dispatched`

A test file was picked up by a runner thread.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | File path. |
| `reservation` | `ResourceAmount` | Resources reserved at dispatch (sum of runner overhead + claim). |

### `file_blocked`

A test file is waiting on the resource pool or PSI pressure.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | File path. |
| `waiting_for` | `ResourceAmount` | What the file is waiting on. |
| `reason` | string | `pool_full`, `psi_pressure`, etc. |

### `file_completed`

A test file finished — successfully, with failures, or terminated by timeout / panic.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | File path. |
| `status` | enum | `passed`, `failed`, `timed_out`, `crashed`. |
| `duration_ns` | u64 | Wall-clock duration. |

`crashed` means the runner panicked or hit a test-infrastructure failure; remaining tests in the file are marked `failed-due-to-poisoned-state`.

## Test lifecycle

### `test_started`

A `test()` block within a file started.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | Containing file's path. |
| `name` | string | `test()` block name. |
| `meta` | `MetaMap` | Per-test metadata. Always present; empty if none. |

### `test_skipped`

The test was filtered or marked Skipped (declarative `meta.skip`, inline `t:skip()`, file-scope `todo()`, or tag/slow filter).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | Containing file's path. |
| `name` | string | Test name. |
| `reason` | string | Filter expression, `t:skip()` argument, or `todo()` argument. |
| `meta` | `MetaMap` | Per-test metadata. |

### `test_passed`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | File path. |
| `name` | string | Test name. |
| `duration_ns` | u64 | Test wall-clock duration. |
| `meta` | `MetaMap` | Per-test metadata. |

### `test_failed`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | File path. |
| `name` | string | Test name. |
| `duration_ns` | u64 | Wall-clock up to failure. |
| `reason` | string | Assertion message, exception text, or panic payload. |
| `console_excerpt` | string | Last 4 KiB from each booted VM's console log. May be empty. |
| `meta` | `MetaMap` | Per-test metadata. |

## VM lifecycle

### `vm_spawned`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `file` | string | File that owns this VM. |
| `vm_name` | string | Name as given to `lab:vm`. |
| `profile` | string | Profile used to boot. |
| `memory_bytes` | u64 | Memory cap. |
| `cid` | u32 | Assigned vsock CID. |

### `vm_shutdown`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `file` | string | File that owned this VM. |
| `vm_name` | string | VM name. |
| `duration_ns` | u64 | VM uptime. |

## Pool and claims

### `pool_state`

Periodic snapshot of resource-pool usage. Default cadence: 1 Hz.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `used` | `ResourceAmount` | Currently in use. |
| `available` | `ResourceAmount` | Currently free. |

### `claim_acquired`

A file successfully claimed resources via `provium:claim(...)`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | File path the claim belongs to. |
| `amount` | `ResourceAmount` | Amount claimed. |

### `claim_released`

A file released its claim. Pairs with `claim_acquired` on the same `path`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | File path. |
| `amount` | `ResourceAmount` | Amount released. |

## Fixtures

### `fixture_build_started`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | Fixture path (test-root-relative, no `.fixture.lua`). |

### `fixture_build_done`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | Fixture path. |
| `duration_ns` | u64 | Build duration. |
| `snapshot_bytes` | u64 | Cached snapshot size, post-compression. |

### `fixture_build_waiting`

A second file is waiting on the build lock another file holds.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | Fixture path being waited on. |
| `held_by_file` | string | File currently holding the build lock. |

### `fixture_cache_hit`

A fixture was resumed from its cached snapshot — no rebuild required.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | Fixture path. |

## Shared types

### `ResourceAmount`

```
{
  "memory_bytes": <u64>,
  "cpus":         <u32>
}
```

Used in pool / claim / reservation events.

### `MetaMap` and `MetaValue`

`MetaMap` is `BTreeMap<String, MetaValue>`. `MetaValue` is a tagged-by-type union over native msgpack types:

| Variant | msgpack mapping |
|---|---|
| `Null` | unit / nil |
| `Bool` | bool |
| `Int` | i64 |
| `Float` | f64 |
| `Str` | str |
| `Bytes` | bin (distinct from str) |
| `Array` | array of MetaValue |
| `Map` | map of String → MetaValue |

The deserializer dispatches on the input type rather than relying on declaration-order fallthrough, so valid-UTF-8 byte sequences are not mis-classified as strings.

## Event guarantees

- `file_discovered` for every discovered file, before any dispatching.
- For each file: at most one `file_dispatched`, optional `file_blocked`(s) before it, exactly one `file_completed` after.
- For each test: exactly one `test_started`, then exactly one of `test_passed` / `test_failed` / `test_skipped`.
- `claim_acquired` and `claim_released` are paired per file.
- `fixture_build_started` and `fixture_build_done` are paired per build. A `fixture_build_waiting` may precede the `_done` if the file queued behind a peer.
- `fixture_cache_hit` fires AFTER successful restore — never on a corrupt entry that turns into a rebuild.

## Consuming the stream

### From a file (replay or post-hoc)

```
provium tests/ --save-events events.msgpack
provium-coverage --from events.msgpack
```

### From stdout (live)

```
provium tests/ --events-stdout | provium-coverage --from -
```

The human-readable renderer redirects to stderr automatically.

### Over a Unix socket (multi-consumer dashboard)

```
provium tests/ --events-socket /tmp/provium.sock --watch
# in another terminal:
provium-coverage --from-socket /tmp/provium.sock
```

The socket persists across `--watch` iterations so connected clients stay connected.
